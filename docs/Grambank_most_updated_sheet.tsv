GB020	Are there definite or specific articles?	1: present, 0: absent						An article is a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity and (in)definiteness. Sometimes these notions of specificity and definiteness are summed up in the term 'identifiability'. The formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone. Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm of markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum, making it hard to define discrete categories, but to qualify as an article a marker should be used in some cases to express definiteness without also expressing a spatial deictic meaning.	article, NP, demonstrative	definiteness, deixis	declension, particle, paradigm	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB021	Do indefinite/non-specific nominals commonly have indefinite/non-specific articles?	1: present, 0: absent						For this feature, we need explicit support that indefinite/non-specific NPs commonly occur with an indefinite/non-specific article. Three or more examples of indefinite/non-specific nominals occurring with an indefinite/non-specific article is sufficient to code 1.  An indefinite article is a marker that accompanies the indefinite noun and expresses notions such as non-specificity and indefiniteness. Sometimes these notions of non-specificity and indefiniteness are summed up in the term ‘identifiability’. A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not be similar in formal expression or position.  The formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone. Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm of markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum, making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning ‘a certain’. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives, and also with classifiers.	article, NP, demonstrative	definiteness, deixis	declension, particle, paradigm	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB022	Are there prenominal articles?	1: present, 0: absent						All questions concerning the order of elements aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order. Articles cover both definite or indefinite articles as defined in [GB020](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB020) and [GB021](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB021) respectively. In order to answer 1 for this feature, the markers' functions need to meet one of those definitions, so 1 should also have been answered for [GB020](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB020) or [GB021](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB021).	article, NP, demonstrative	definiteness, deixis	word order, declension, particle, paradigm, prefixation	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB023	Are there postnominal articles?	1: present, 0: absent						All questions concerning the order of elements aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order. Articles cover both definite or indefinite articles as defined in [GB020](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB020) and [GB021](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB021) respectively. In order to answer 1 for this feature, the markers' functions need to meet one of those definitions, so 1 should also have been answered for [GB020](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB020) or [GB021](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB021).	article, NP, demonstrative	definiteness, deixis	word order, declension, particle, paradigm, suffixation	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB024	What is the order of numeral and noun in the NP?	multistate 1: Num-N; 2: N-Num; 3: both.						This feature focuses on the order of cardinal numerals (not ordinal numerals) and nouns in quantified noun phrases. In some languages only one order (Numeral-Noun or Noun-Numeral) is possible. In other languages both orders may be possible. This can take the form of free variation (where Numeral-Noun and Noun-Numeral order can occur interchangeably). The order may also depend on some other grammatical category which is neutral with respect to pragmaticality (e.g. definiteness). If the order depends on the noun, consider only the orders that apply to an open class of nouns and disregard orders that are restricted to a specific closed class of nouns.	numeral, NP	quantification, attribution	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB025	What is the order of adnominal demonstrative and noun?	multistate 1: Dem-N; 2: N-Dem; 3: both.						This feature is concerned with the order of the noun and adnominal demonstratives (i.e. demonstratives that modify the noun). There are three possible values to code: 1, before the noun, 2, after the noun, or 3, both orders are possible. Like all questions concerning the order of elements, only the pragmatically unmarked orders are targeted.	demonstrative, NP	deixis, attribution	word order	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB026	Can adnominal property words occur discontinuously?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature describes an adnominal property word denoting core adjectival concepts such as shape, value, dimension, age, color (at a minimum -- many other meanings are possible) which can be separated from the noun it modifies by some element that is not part of the nominal phrase. For example, can you say ***the man** is running **big*** to mean ‘**the big man** is running’?  Typically a language which allows this has extensive [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent (e.g. the ‘Australian type’). NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here. This features aims specifically to capture the phenomenon of a single NP whose head and modifiers can be separated. Examples of the type *I painted the house red* or *I saw the boy big* are not necessarily discontinuous, but most likely resultative or contrastive (*I saw the boy big* [as opposed to before when he was small]). These should be disregarded for the purposes of this feature.	adjective, clause, NP	attribution	word order, special construction	Hannah J. Haynie
GB027	Are nominal conjunction and comitative expressed by different elements?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a difference between the marking of NP coordination (*John **and** Mary went to market.*) and the marking of comitative phrases (*John **with** Mary went to market.*)? In some languages the only way to coordinate noun phrases is with a comitative phrase, i.e. the only way to say ‘X **and** Y’ is ‘X **with** Y’. To see whether an element is comitative or coordinating you can check case marking and agreement. For example, if X is the element in question and in the dative you get ‘John-DAT X Mary-DAT’, then X is likely coordinating. If you get ‘John-DAT X Mary’, X is likely comitative. If there is agreement, if you get ‘John X Mary verb-PL’ rather than 'John X Mary verb-SG' (just like ‘John X suitcase verb-SG’), this suggests that X is coordinating.	adposition, case marker, NP	argument marking, oblique, conjunction, coordination, case marking, comitative	declension, flagging	Hedvig Skirgård
GB028	Is there a distinction between inclusive and exclusive?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a pronoun or other marker that explicitly marks the inclusion of an interlocutor? This feature is not restricted to the pronominal system but includes person [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) as well. If inclusive is marked overtly in either the pronominal system or through verbal marking this is sufficient to trigger a 1 for this feature, even if exclusive has no overt morphological marking.	pronoun, index, verb	clusivity, deixis, person, number	declension, paradigm, indexing	Hannah J. Haynie
GB030	Is there a gender distinction in phonologically independent third person pronouns?	1: present, 0: absent						This question targets the existence of any [gender distinction](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) in [phonologically independent third person pronouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns). For the purposes of this feature we define third person pronouns as including demonstratives. A masculine/feminine distinction is commonly encoded in third person pronouns, but distinctions in any other noun class/gender categories such as animacy also satisfy the criterion for coding a 1 for this feature. For languages with no third person independent pronouns or no noun class/gender distinctions in third person pronouns, a gender distinction in demonstratives would be sufficient to trigger a 1 here. If pronouns with just inanimate referents (or alternatively, just animate referents) agree with the noun class/gender of the corresponding noun that also suffices for 1. If a language has any gender distinction for third person pronouns but not for demonstratives, this is also sufficient for a 1. For more information on the difference between grammatical gender and social, cultural, and biological constructs or traits, see the [gender wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Grammatical-gender-and-other-notions-of-gender).	pronoun	person, number, gender	declension, paradigm	Hannah J. Haynie
GB031	Is there a dual or unit augmented form (in addition to plural or augmented) for all person categories in the pronoun or person index system?	1: present, 0: absent						A dual or unit augmented form must be present throughout the paradigm (i.e. for all person categories) for this feature to be coded as 1. Both [independent pronouns and bound person indexes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) are to be considered in coding this feature. Inclusive and exclusive categories of first person are not considered separate person categories for the purposes of coding this feature (e.g. if a language has dual number in third, second, and any first person category it is sufficient for triggering a 1). A dual or unit augmented form for a single person category in the paradigm is *not* sufficient for a 1 code.	pronoun	person, number	declension, paradigm	Hannah J. Haynie
GB035	Are there three or more distance contrasts in adnominal demonstratives?	1: present, 0: absent						Demonstratives are modifiers that can modify nouns (of any type and not just a restricted set such as location nouns) to mark position (e.g. deixis or reference within discourse). This doesn't have to be only Euclidean distance (meters, inches etc.), it could also be concerned with near or far in relation to the interlocutors (cf. Wolof). If the system of adnominal demonstratives includes an anaphoric demonstrative this does not count as a third distance.	demonstrative	deixis	declension, paradigm	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB036	Do adnominal demonstratives show an elevation distinction?	1: present, 0: absent						Elevation is concerned with how high or how low an object is (in altitude).	demonstrative	deixis	declension, paradigm	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB037	Do adnominal demonstratives show a visible-nonvisible distinction?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a distinction visible vs. non-visible when referencing to items that are the same relative distance? It is not relevant that adnominal demonstratives denoting far away reference often also imply non-visibility.	demonstrative	deixis	declension, paradigm	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB038	Are there demonstrative classifiers?	1: present, 0: absent						This question asks whether there is a [classifier system](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) in which classifiers appear with demonstratives to classify the noun. This classifier system can be symmetrical with numeral, possessive or verbal classifiers. It is sufficient if they sometimes occur. Please note, this feature does not concern gender/noun classes and agreement with the noun class, but a separate nominal classifier system.	demonstrative, classifier, NP	deixis, nominal classification, attribution	declension, paradigm, special construction, particle	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB039	Is there nonphonological allomorphy of noun number markers?	1: present, 0: absent						Are there different number markers for a single number category? And is the choice between these markers unpredictable from the marker a noun receives in another number category? For example, are there different plural markers while there is only one (or no) singular marker? Or do two nouns receive different singular markers but the same plural marker? This feature targets bound number markers, free number markers, and clitics.	noun, NP	number	declension	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB041	Are there several nouns (more than three) which are suppletive for number?	1: present, 0: absent						Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. An example of this is English _went_ and _go_. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. Only so called 'strong suppletion' counts here, 'weak' suppletion is not included.  Only answer 1 if there are more than three examples of strong suppletion. Body parts and kinship terms are a good place to start investigating.	noun	number	suppletion, declension	Hedvig Skirgård
GB042	Is there a productive overt morphological singular marker on nouns?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of singular number on nouns. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. Absence of plural marking does not count for a 1 here (hence the emphasis on ‘overt’ in the feature question). This feature contrasts with [GB316 Is singular number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB316) which focuses on the non-bound marking of singular number. For more on bound marking, please see this [page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.  Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still trigger a 1 code, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the distinctions in number and as long as number marking is productive.	noun	number, gender	declension	Hedvig Skirgård
GB043	Is there a productive morphological dual marker on nouns?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of dual number on nouns. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB317 Is dual number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element? ](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB317) which focuses on the non-bound marking of dual number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.  Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.  It can be difficult to determine how obligatory markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writer describes the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.	noun	number	declension	Hedvig Skirgård
GB044	Is there a productive morphological plural marker on nouns?	1: present, 0: absent						"This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of plural number on nouns. This feature contrasts with [GB318	Is plural number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB318) which focuses on non-bound marking of plural number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1. Reduplication (full or partial) does not count for this feature.  The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. Classes of animate nouns or human nouns are large and open enough. Kinship terms however are a restricted set since it is very hard to add new members.  Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular."	noun	number, gender	declension	Hedvig Skirgård
GB046	Is there an associative plural marker for nouns?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature aims to cover any marking that marks that the reference contains entities associated with an entity X ('X and other people/things associated with X') instead of indicating additive plural ('several instances of X'). For example, _the King_**_-s_** _went to the market_ means several kings went. An associative plural interpretation of *-s* would be 'the King and his entourage went to the market'. This marking does not need to be bound to the noun. If the additive plural also has this function, this also counts.  The associative marker may be described as a pronoun. Comitative markers do not generally count. The marker should be linked to the person whom the others are associated with, and not the other way around.	noun	number	declension	Hedvig Skirgård
GB047	Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an action/state noun from a verb?	1: present, 0: absent						An action nominalization derives from a verb and functions like a noun or noun phrase. The result denotes an action or state. In English, we can exemplify this with *the enemy’s **destruction** of the city*. *Arrive* - ***arriving*** could also serves as an example, or, in Spanish, *La **concentración** de Sherlock Holmes duró cinco horas.* ‘Sherlock Holmes’ **concentration** lasted five hours’. This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) overt nominalizers, including affixes, clitics, tonal markers, reduplication, ablaut, etc. There needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) derivation. The derived noun may also refer to states or events in addition to actions. The nominalization strategy may also derive other types of nominalization. Compounds of a verb root and a noun meaning 'action', 'state' or 'event are not action nominalizations unless further grammaticalized.	noun, verb	derivation, nominalization, gender	derivational morphology	Hedvig Skirgård
GB048	Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an agent noun from a verb?	1: present, 0: absent						An agent nominalization derives from a verb and functions like a noun or noun phrase. The result denotes the agent of an action. In English, we can exemplify this with the productive _-er_ suffix (_bak-er_, _fish-er_, *garden-er*, etc.). This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) overt nominalizers, including affixes, clitics, tonal markers, reduplication, ablaut, etc. This derivation pattern needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity). Compounds of a verb root and a noun meaning 'person' are likely not agent nominalizations.	noun, verb	derivation, nominalization, gender	derivational morphology	Hedvig Skirgård
GB049	Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an object noun from a verb?	1: present, 0: absent						An object nominalization derives from a verb and functions like a noun or noun phrase. The result denotes the object or result of an action (e.g. *song* is derived from *to sing*). This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) overt nominalizers, including affixes, clitics, tonal markers, reduplication, ablaut, etc. There needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) derivation for this feature to be coded 1. The nominalization strategy may also derive other types of nominalization. A compound of a verb root and a noun meaning 'thing' is not an object nominalization unless there is evidence that the noun has grammaticalized into an affix. Instrument derivations are not relevant since they do not denote the object resulting from the action/state.	noun, verb	derivation, nominalization, gender	derivational morphology	Hedvig Skirgård
GB051	Is there a noun class/gender system where masculine and feminine categories are a factor in class assignment?	1: present, 0: absent						A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the categories _masculine_ and _feminine_ are relevant for noun class/gender assignment in a given language. A contrast between these categories in a noun class/gender system serves as a minimal criterion for this feature to be coded 1. Languages that overtly mark only one of these categories (e.g. feminine, with an unmarked class interpreted as non-feminine) do encode the relevant distinction and should be coded 1. A language may encode other socially or culturally relevant gender distinctions, and there may be cross-linguistic and cross-cultural differences in the semantics and membership of masculine and feminine categories. A language may also categorize nouns based on other factors entirely (e.g. shape, animacy, phonological properties). For the purposes of this feature, grammatical categories other than masculine and feminine should be disregarded.  The use of these two specific categories in the definition of this feature is meant to enable consistent coding and interpretation of data for a narrowly-defined, cross-linguistically common distinction. This is not meant to represent social or cultural gender constructs or particular biological traits, nor is it intended to reflect the full diversity of grammatical gender systems. For more information on the difference between grammatical gender and social, cultural, and biological constructs or traits, see the [gender wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Grammatical-gender-and-other-notions-of-gender).	noun	gender	declension	Hannah J. Haynie
GB052	Is there a noun class/gender system where shape is a factor in class assignment?	1: present, 0: absent						A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the shape of an object is one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified to certain gender categories as a result of their _shape_ for this feature to be coded 1. That is, shape must be one relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment.  Note that noun class markers are sometimes used to mark diminutives and augmentatives; this feature focuses specifically on shape (e.g. long, round, square, wide) and should _not_ be coded 1 if noun class markers associated with some other semantic categories (e.g. masculine and feminine) are recruited for diminutive and augmentative forms unless there is some other clear shape-based assignment.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah J. Haynie
GB053	Is there a noun class/gender system where animacy is a factor in class assignment?	1: present, 0: absent						A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the animacy of a noun is one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of their animacy for this feature to be coded 1. That is, animacy must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment.  Note that while masculine and feminine categories are generally associated with animate referents, a gender system that makes a distinction between these categories is not necessarily sufficient to trigger a 1 here. A gender system in which animacy is a relevant factor will often make a distinction between human or animal referents and non-living referents, and animate status may be extended to culturally important non-living entities (e.g. mythological figures) or objects (e.g. celestial bodies). A human/non-human distinction is sufficient for a 1 code.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah J. Haynie
GB054	Is there a noun class/gender system where plant status is a factor in class assignment?	1: present, 0: absent						A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether one of these factors distinguishes plants from other concepts. For this feature to be coded 1, there must be a clear pattern in which nouns that refer to plants or some subset of plant referents are assigned to one or more specific noun classes.  Although the semantic factors in noun class/gender assignment are not always perfectly clear-cut, this feature targets those systems in which certain nouns are assigned to a particular class *because* their referents are plants. Systems in which several nominals with plant referents are assigned to a particular class because of their phonology or due to some more or less arbitrary assignment are not the target of this feature. That is, plant status must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender. However, it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment for a particular category.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah J. Haynie
GB057	Are there numeral classifiers?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns whether some cardinal numerals [obligatorily](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) occur with a marker that varies depending on the modified noun. This marker should not be the same as a marker of a [noun class/gender system](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) used also on noun modifiers other than cardinal numerals (e.g. demonstratives) or on predicates. The nouns in question should be of high countability, such as people, animals and objects, rather than of low countability, such as water, sand and smoke.	numeral, classifier, NP	nominal classification, quantification, attribution	declension, paradigm, special construction, particle	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB058	Are there possessive classifiers?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns whether there is an independent [classifier](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) system in possessive constructions that is not related to other nominal classification systems such as the gender/noun class of the language or numeral classifiers.  We are concerned with markers that signal the nature of the possessor (possessor classifiers) or the possessum (possessed classifiers). This feature applies to both pronominal/nominal possessors and markers which are [bound or free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). Possessive classifiers need not be obligatory, it may also be possible to construct possessive phrases without possessive classifiers.  Differences in the expression of individual, joint, separate and group possession are not relevant here.	noun, classifier, NP	attributive possession, attribution, nominal classification	declension, paradigm, special construction, particle	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB059	Is the adnominal possessive construction different for alienable and inalienable nouns?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a morpho-syntactic difference in attributive possession that can be ascribed to alienability?  This feature applies to constructions with both pronominal and nominal possessors.  Typically, inalienable possession applies to the semantic domains of body parts and kinship, but it is sometimes found in other categories that do not align perfectly with the canonical notion of 'alienability', such as part-whole relationships other than body parts, social relationships other than kinship, or things inherently linked to a person (e.g. a person's voice, mental states, or other attributes).  This feature targets splits in possessive marking where different classes of possessum are associated with different constructions, and where one of those possessum classes includes body parts and/or kinship terms, and possibly other categories that have strong semantic associations with their owners, social relationships, or part-whole relationships.	noun, NP	attributive possession, attribution, alienability	declension, special construction, particle	Hannah J. Haynie
GB065	What is the pragmatically unmarked order of adnominal possessor and possessed noun?	multistate 1:Possessor-Possessed; 2:Possessed-Possessor; 3: both						This feature focuses on the relative order of possessor and possessum (i.e. that which is possessed) in an adnominal possession construction. Coding should take into consideration only those possession constructions that are pragmatically unmarked (e.g. not focus). This feature applies to both nominal possessors and [independent pronominal](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) possessors. [Affixal](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) marking of possession, by contrast, is coded in features [GB430](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB430)-[GB433](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB433).	noun, NP, index	attributive possession, attribution	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB068	Do property words (defined semantically as property concepts such as value, shape, age, dimension) act like verbs in predicative position?	1: present, 0: absent						Do property words used as predicates take on verbal morphology? The predicative property word need not take exactly all verbal marking. If there is at least some marking that verbs and predicative property words share, this counts as 1 (for example, if a language has *he runs* and *he greens*). However, if there is additional morphology or there are additional elements that the property word requires, then this feature should be coded as 0. This should apply to most property words in the language. Property words semantically roughly correspond to adjectives in those languages that have a separate adjective word class. We want to include elements that mark ‘adjectival’ function but that might not be described as ‘adjectives’.	adjective, verb, index	predication, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, nominal classification, gender	declension, conjugation, indexing	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB069	Do adnominal property words (defined semantically as property concepts; value, shape, age, dimension) used attributively require the same morphological treatment as verbs?	1: present, 0: absent						Do adnominal property words receive the same treatment as verbs when verbs are used attributively, i.e. inside an NP? The adnominal property word need not take exactly all verbal marking. If there is at least some marking that verbal and adnominal property words share, this counts as 1. The result need not be finite: participles count as attributively used verbs. This means that if the language in question forms modifying verbs by participles (*the running man*) and this is the same for adnominal property word roots (*the redding man*), this counts as 1. Property words semantically correspond to adjectives in those languages that have a separate adjective word class. We want to include elements that mark 'adjectival' function but that might not be described as 'adjectives.'	adjective, verb, index	attribution, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, nominal classification, gender	declension, conjugation, indexing	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB070	Are there morphological cases for non-pronominal core arguments (i.e. S, A or P)?	1: present, 0: absent						Morphological case involves any type of case marking (or flagging) that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, etc.). [Core arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) are those having S, A or P function. If a bound marker distinguishes S from non-S NPs, this counts for a 1 code. Optional marking and marking with portmanteau morphemes (e.g. a marker both indicates that a noun phrase is plural and that it has P function) also count.	noun, NP, case marker	argument marking, core arguments	declension, flagging	Jakob Lesage
GB071	Are there morphological cases for phonologically independent personal pronominal core arguments (i.e. S, A or P)?	1: present, 0: absent						This question is about [phonologically independent pronouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) only; indexes are irrelevant. Morphological case involves any type of case marking that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, etc.). Core arguments are those having [S, A or P function](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). If a bound marker distinguishes S from non-S pronouns, this counts as 1. Optional marking and marking with portmanteau morphemes (e.g. a marker both indicates that a noun phrase is plural and that it has P function) also count.	pronoun, case marker	argument marking, core arguments	declension, flagging	Jakob Lesage
GB072	Are there morphological cases for oblique non-pronominal NPs (i.e. not S, A or P)?	1: present, 0: absent						Morphological case involves any type of case marking that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, etc.). Oblique NPs are NPs having a function other than [S, A or P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)), e.g. dative, locative, ablative instrumental, comitative, location in time, etc. If a phonologically free adposition agrees in gender, number or person with the noun phrase, it does not count as a case marker for the purpose of this feature. Note that genitive or possessive are not seen as cases for this feature.	noun, NP, case marker	argument marking, oblique	declension, flagging	Jakob Lesage
GB073	Are there morphological cases for phonologically independent oblique personal pronouns (i.e. not S, A or P)?	1: present, 0: absent						Are phonologically independent personal pronouns morphologically marked for oblique case (i.e. not [S, A or P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)))? Morphological case involves any type of case marking (or flagging) that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, etc.). Suppletion also counts as case marking for this feature. Oblique NPs are NPs having a function other than S, A or P, e.g. dative, locative, ablative, instrumental, comitative, location in time, etc. Note that genitive or possessive are not seen as cases for this feature.	pronoun, case marker	argument marking, oblique	declension, flagging	Jakob Lesage
GB074	Are there prepositions?	1: present, 0: absent						A preposition indicates the relationship of a noun phrase to the verb in a clause. This relationship could be circumstantial (e.g. locative, temporal, etc.) or a [core argument function (S, A or P)](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). A preposition precedes the noun phrase it occurs with. Proclitics with this function count as prepositions in Grambank. This means that [phonological boundness](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) is not relevant to this question. Circumpositions count both as prepositions and as postpositions. Inpositions (which occur somewhere in between words in a noun phrase) do not count as prepositions. Nouns that express the function of an adposition in a possessive construction (e.g. ***inside** of the car* to mean 'in the car') only count if they are visibly grammaticalized and no longer fully behave like nouns. If there is only one preposition, this is enough for a 1 here.	noun, NP, case marker, adposition	argument marking, core arguments, oblique	word order, flagging	Jakob Lesage
GB075	Are there postpositions?	1: present, 0: absent						A postposition indicates the relationship of a noun phrase to the verb in a clause. This relationship could be circumstantial (e.g. locative, temporal, etc.) or a [core argument function (S, A or P)](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). A postposition follows the noun phrase it occurs with. Enclitics with this function count as postpositions in Grambank. This means that [phonological boundness](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) is not relevant to this question. Circumpositions count as both postpositions and prepositions. Inpositions (which occur somewhere in between words in a noun phrase) do not count as postpositions. Nouns that express the function of an adposition in a possessive construction (e.g. ***inside** of the car* to mean 'in the car') only count if they are visibly grammaticalized and no longer fully behave like nouns. If there is only one postposition, this is enough for a 1 here.	noun, NP, case marker, adposition	argument marking, core arguments, oblique	word order, flagging	Jakob Lesage
GB079	Do verbs have prefixes or proclitics other than S, A or P indexes (do include indexes that also mark TAM or negation)?	1: present, 0: absent						These [prefixes or proclitics](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) could have a variety of functions, marking TAME, functioning as verbal derivation markers, as inverse markers, relative markers, etc. Only [indexes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) dedicated to core argument marking do not count. The end result has to be a finite verb and cannot, for example, be a deverbal noun or an adverb.	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, oblique, TAM, negation, tense, aspect, mood, modality, valency change	conjugation, prefixation	Jakob Lesage
GB080	Do verbs have suffixes or enclitics other than S, A or P indexes (do include indexes that also mark TAM or negation)?	1: present, 0: absent						These [suffixes or enclitics](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) could have a variety of functions, marking TAME, functioning as verbal derivation markers, as inverse markers, relative markers, etc. Only [indexes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) dedicated to core argument marking do not count. The end result has to be a finite verb and cannot, for example, be a deverbal noun or an adverb.	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, oblique, TAM, negation, tense, aspect, mood, modality, valency change	conjugation, suffixation	Jakob Lesage
GB081	Is there productive infixation in verbs?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature targets the existence of [affixation](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) that is stem-internal, [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), and dedicated to one or more specific grammatical functions. If the only infixation process described for a language involves reduplication, please code 0 but be sure to note in the comments field that infixing reduplication is present. For the purposes of this feature tonal alternations are not considered to be a form of infixation, nor are 'vocalic melodies' as in Semitic languages; these phenomena should be disregarded in coding this feature. Note that the terms 'stem' and 'infix' may be used differently across some grammar writing traditions, so care must be taken to examine the structure of relevant forms rather than relying on the use of these terms. Here we are interested in infixes that occur internal to the base form of a verb that is held in common across inflected forms (called the 'stem' here), rather than affixes that occur between a verb's root or stem and some inflectional affix(es) or clitic(s).	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, oblique, TAM, negation, tense, aspect, mood, modality, valency change	conjugation, infixation	Hannah J. Haynie
GB082	Is there overt morphological marking of present tense on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent						"This question aims to capture productive paradigms of overt tense marking. 'Morphological marking on the verb' means that the marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verb. The marking of tense can involve affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims to capture overt marking of present tense on the verb. Lack of other marking is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example some grammarians state that present tense is expressed by a certain aspect on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing present tense then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB082) and the feature on tense auxiliaries ([GB121](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB121)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing present tense, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.  Sometimes a language is described as having a past/non-past distinction. In this case, if there is an overt marker of non-past code the language as 1 for this feature (GB082), but 0 for the feature on future tense [GB084](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB084). Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas present tense has less strict demands on the scope of its function. This situation is mirrored for future/non-future which results in a 1 for GB082 and GB084 but a 0 for GB083 (if both have over markers). It is however not acceptable for a present tense marker to occur in both future and past contexts.  If there is a tense system with a ""hodiernal"" category, i.e ""the day of speaking"", that also includes past events of the same day, this is permissible to code as a present tense marker."	verb	TAM, tense	conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB083	Is there overt morphological marking on the verb dedicated to past tense?	1: present, 0: absent						This question aims to capture [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) paradigms of overt tense marking. ‘Morphological marking on the verb’ means that the marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verb. The marking of tense can involve affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims to capture overt marking of past tense on the verb. Lack of other marking is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example some grammarians state that past tense is expressed by a certain aspect on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expression past tense then this construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB083) and the feature on tense auxiliaries ([GB121](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB121)). If the marking of past tense is accomplished by more than one marker and at least one is bound, code 1. If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing past tense, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.  The past tense marker should be dedicated to past tense and not also mark perfective aspect, present, or future. A non-future marker is not enough for a 1 here.	verb	TAM, tense	conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB084	Is there overt morphological marking on the verb dedicated to future tense?	1: present, 0: absent						This question aims to capture [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) paradigms of overt tense marking. 'Morphological marking on the verb' means that the marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verb. The marking of tense can involve affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims to capture overt marking of future tense on the verb. Lack of other marking is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and an auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that future tense is expressed by a certain marker on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing future tense then this construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB084) and the feature on tense auxiliaries ([GB121](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB121)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing future tense, only consider the marking that is obligatory.  Sometimes a language will be described as having a past/non-past distinction. In this case, if there is an overt marker of non-past code the language as 1 for the feature on present tense ([GB082](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB082)), but 0 for this feature (GB084). Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas present tense has less strict demands on the scope of its function.  It can be hard to distinguish future tense from different modal categories, after all if something is in the future it has not yet occurred and can be construed as something wished for, planned, intended, etc. For this reason, it is necessary to pay particular attention to sections on mood, especially irrealis, when coding for future tense.  If a language only has future tense under negation, this does not count for this feature. It needs to be present for affirmation as well. The reason for this is that conditions such as 'only under negation' are likely to give rise to quite different analysis by different linguists (hence it is hard to ensure comparability) and might also be overlooked. If we were to treat such marginal cases as triggering 1 we would most likely have to go back to a lot of the cases that were coded as 0 and re-evaluate their coding more thoroughly.	verb	TAM, tense	conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB086	Is a morphological distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect available on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature is concerned with [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) marking of imperfective and perfective grammatical aspects. These categories could go by the name of punctual and continuous, preterit and progressive, etc. The answer could be 1 even if only one of these is overtly marked, e.g. if the imperfective is marked by an affix and the perfective is marked by an auxiliary. Please take notice that this feature (GB086) and the features on aspectual auxiliaries [GB120](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB120) and particles [GB520](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB520) do not cover exactly the same functions. The features on auxiliaries and particles cover more grammatical aspects than just perfective and imperfective.  If this distinction is only available in some TAM-conditions, this counts as well. For example, if there is no aspectual distinction in the past but it only exists in the present, this still triggers a 1.	verb	TAM, aspect	conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB089	Can the S argument be indexed by a suffix/enclitic on the verb in the simple independent clause?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) [S argument](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) [index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) that follows its verbal host (i.e. attaches to it as a [suffix or an enclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics))?	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, person, number, gender	conjugation, indexing, suffixation	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich

GB091	Can the A argument be indexed by a suffix/enclitic on the verb in the simple independent clause?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) [A argument](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) [index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) that follows its verbal host (i.e. attaches to it as a [suffix or an enclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics))?	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, person, number, gender	conjugation, indexing, suffixation	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB092	Can the A argument be indexed by a prefix/proclitic on the verb in the simple independent clause?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) [A argument](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) [index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) that precedes its verbal host (i.e. attaches to it as a [prefix or a proclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics))?	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, person, number, gender	conjugation, indexing, prefixation	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB093	Can the P argument be indexed by a suffix/enclitic on the verb in the simple independent clause?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) [P argument](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) [index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) that follows its verbal host (i.e. attaches to it as a [suffix or an enclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics))?	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, person, number, gender	conjugation, indexing, suffixation	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich

GB095	Are variations in marking strategies of core participants based on TAM distinctions?	1: present, 0: absent						Marking strategies of core participants include both marking by [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) and by flagging (i.e. case or adposition marking). Variations in marking strategies include both variations in the alignment patterns and variations in position (e.g. suffixing vs. prefixing) in case of indexes. This question includes some of the cases referred to as (alignment) split in the literature. Merely different allomorphs of person/number indexes in the same position do not count. Polarity (i.e. positive vs. negative distinction) does not count as a TAM category. Absence of overt indexing in the imperative does not count either.	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, person, number, gender	flagging, indexing	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB096	Are variations in marking strategies of core participants based on verb classes?	1: present, 0: absent						Marking strategies include both marking by [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) and by flagging. The distinction between intransitive and transitive verbs is not included here. Variations in marking strategies include both variations in the alignment patterns and variations in position (e.g. suffixing vs. prefixing) in case of indexes. Mere differences in forms of the indexes triggered by various conjugation classes are not sufficient for 1. For a language to be coded 1 the respective verb classes need to be of a substantial size (several dozen verbs or more) and ideally represent a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) pattern. The presence of small verb classes whose members are often exhaustively listed in a descriptive grammar and are presented as exceptional patterns does not qualify as 1. The patterns of interest are more common with intransitive verbs and include cases of the so-called active-inactive alignment (or simply: active, agentive-patientive or stative-active) in cases of differentially marked [S arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). Some grammars use the terms unergative-unaccusative verbs. The pattern of interest is, however, not restricted to the S argument. Variations in marking of [A and P arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) are also included.	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, verb classification, person, number, gender	flagging, indexing	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB098	Are variations in marking strategies of core participants based on person distinctions?	1: present, 0: absent						Marking strategies of core participants include both marking by [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) and by flagging (i.e. case or adposition marking). Variations in marking strategies include both variations in the alignment patterns and variations in position (e.g. suffixing vs. prefixing) in case of indexes. Mere differences in forms of the indexes triggered by various conjugation classes are not sufficient for a 1. This question includes cases referred to as person-based (alignment) split and hierarchical alignment in the literature.	verb, index, pronoun	argument marking, core arguments, person, person, number, gender	flagging, indexing	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB099	Is there verb suppletion for participant person?	1: present, 0: absent						Do some verbs have two or more suppletive allomorphs whose distribution is conditioned by the person of an [S, A, or P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument? Suppletive allomorphs are allomorphs which are not similar in pronunciation, i.e. they cannot be related to each other by morpho-phonological rules. This question covers strong suppletion, weak suppletion, and ablaut. There must be at least **three** such verbs to code 1 for this feature.	verb	person, argument marking, core arguments	suppletion, ablaut, conjugation	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB103	Can a verb have a benefactive marker (applicative marker or index)?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) verbal marker that signals that the verb has a beneficiary. The marker could be analyzed in the language-specific case as voice, [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or a 'bound pronoun'. In some languages, applicative markers may be used to topicalize, focalize or background a beneficiary. This type of marking also counts for this feature. The marker does not have to index the beneficiary. Autobenefactive markers do not count and serial verb constructions that include a benefactive verb (typically 'give') do not count.	verb, index	argument marking, oblique, valency change, applicative, benefactive, derivation, valency increase	derivational morphology, conjugation	Jakob Lesage
GB104	Can a verb have an instrumental marker (applicative marker or index)?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) verbal marker that signals that the verb has an instrument. In some languages, applicative markers may be used to topicalize, focalize or background the instrument. This type of marking also counts for this feature. The marker could be analyzed in the language-specific case as voice, [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or a ‘bound pronoun’. The marker does not have to index the instrument.	verb, index	argument marking, oblique, valency change, applicative, instrumental, derivation, valency increase	derivational morphology, conjugation	Jakob Lesage
GB105	Can the recipient in a ditransitive construction be marked like the transitive patient?	1: present, 0: absent						As a ditransitive construction we consider constructions with ditransitive verbs expressing a physical transfer of possession or a mental transfer of messages (*give*, *lend*, *hand*, *feed*, *send*, *bring*, *show*, *tell*, *teach*). A ditransitive verb must allow overt expression of an agent, a theme and a recipient/addressee as separate NPs. The morphological marking of these arguments (e.g. accusative case, dative case vs. adposition marking) is irrelevant for counting a verb as ditransitive.  ‘Marking’ for the purposes of this feature includes both flagging (i.e. case and adposition marking) and [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) on the verb. 1 is primarily triggered by flagging. Only if there is no overt flagging for neither the P argument nor the recipient argument, indexing is considered. 1 covers both the ‘double-object construction’ and the ‘secondary-object construction’ of Haspelmath (2013).	noun, NP, verb, index, case marker	argument marking, core, oblique, verb classification, derivation	special construction, flagging, indexing, conjugation	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB107	Can standard negation be marked by an affix, clitic or modification of the verb?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature refers to Standard Negation, i.e. the constructions that mark negation of (at least) dynamic (not-stative) verbal predicates in declarative mood. The marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verbal root, be it by affixation, cliticization, suppletion, reduplication, tone, etc. For markers bound to auxiliaries, see [GB298](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB298). If there is negative marking on the verb and elsewhere (for example by a particle) in the same construction, this is included in this feature.	verb	TAM, negation	conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB108	Is there directional or locative morphological marking on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) verbal marker that signals the direction or location of the event/state/action. A marker that indicates that something happens in multiple directions does not count here.	verb	argument marking, oblique, applicative, valency change, derivation, valency increase	derivational morphology, conjugation	Jakob Lesage
GB109	Is there verb suppletion for participant number?	1: present, 0: absent						Are there verbs that use a different stem depending on the number (singular, dual, plural, etc.) of a core participant? The participant triggering the suppletive choice could be [A, P, or S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). Auxiliary verbs are also considered verbs for the purpose of this feature.  Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. An example of this is English *went* and *go*. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. Only strong suppletion (different stems) counts. There should be at least three verbs with participant number suppletion to count as 1. If only one or two verbs are described as exhibiting suppletion, code 0. If the author gives two examples but states or implies that it is more common, code 1.  Only so called 'strong suppletion' counts here, 'weak' suppletion is not included.	verb	number, argument marking, core arguments	suppletion, conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB110	Is there verb suppletion for tense or aspect?	1: present, 0: absent						Are there verbs that use a different stem depending on the tense or aspect (present, past, perfective etc.) they occur in? Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. An example of this is English *went* and *go*. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. Only strong suppletion (different stems) counts, ‘weak’ suppletion is not included. At least three verbal concepts should indicate different tense or aspect values with suppletive stems to trigger a 1.	verb	TAM, tense, aspect	suppletion, conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB111	Are there conjugation classes?	1: present, 0: absent						Are there multiple sets of verbs that each combine with different sets of (inflectional) markers in finite forms? We are concerned with whether there is non-phonological allomorphy of finiteness marking on verbs depending on which verb is chosen. Phonological rules are not considered here but they may correlate with non-phonological allomorphy. Conjugation classes that are lexically assigned are relevant for coding this feature. Please note that a class of suppletive verbs does not count.  Look for finiteness markers such as: * Person: first, second, third * Number: singular, plural, dual and trial * Gender: masculine, feminine or neuter * Tense: present, past, or future * Aspect: perfect, perfective, progressive * Mood: indicative, subjunctive, imperative, optative * Voice: active, middle, or passive	verb, index	TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, negation, verb classification, argument marking, core, oblique	conjugation	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB113	Are there verbal affixes or clitics that turn intransitive verbs into transitive ones?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature asks whether intransitive verbs can take a [phonologically bound morpheme](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) that signals the addition of just one role in the event denoted by the verb. This could be a causative affix or clitic, an applicative marker (benefactive, instrumental, etc.), etc. The marker has to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity). Note that there is no logical dependency with [GB155](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB155) on causative markers, as a language could have causatives that change a verb's valency from 2 to 3 but not from 1 to 2.	verb, index	valency change, derivation, valency increase, causative, applicative	derivational morphology, affixation	Jakob Lesage
GB114	Is there a phonologically bound reflexive marker on the verb?	1: present, 0: absent						A reflexive marker indicates that a participant is coreferential with another participant in the clause or sentence. This marker may indicate both reflexive and reciprocal functions. If a ‘middle-voice’ marker is used to mark reflexive functions, it also counts as a reflexive marker. Reduplication of verbs also counts. The reflexive construction needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not limited to a small set of likely lexicalized verbs in the language, to trigger 1 for this feature.	verb, index	reflexive, valency change, derivation, valency decrease	derivational morphology, indexing	Jakob Lesage
GB115	Is there a phonologically bound reciprocal marker on the verb?	1: present, 0: absent						A reciprocal marker indicates that an action or feeling is mutual between two or more parties (e.g. *they love each other*; *they beat each other*). A reciprocal marker may indicate both reflexive and reciprocal functions. Reduplication of verbs also counts. Reciprocal marking needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not limited to a small set of verbs in the language that are probably lexicalized. This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) reciprocal markers.	verb, index	reflexive, reciprocal, valency change, derivation, valency decrease	derivational morphology, indexing	Jakob Lesage
GB116	Do verbs classify the shape, size or consistency of absolutive arguments by means of incorporated nouns, verbal affixes or suppletive verb stems?	1: present, 0: absent						This question aims to capture the classification of shape, size or consistency of absolutive arguments with verbal classifiers. Incorporated nouns, verbal affixes or suppletive verb stems are types of [verbal classifiers](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers). This feature is concerned with verbal classifiers and not whether the verb agrees with the [gender/noun class](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) of the noun. Verbal classifiers can, however, be identical or very similar to possessive, numeral or demonstrative classifier systems.	verb, index	nominal classification	incorporation, compounding, suppletion, affixation, conjugation	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB117	Is there a copula for predicate nominals?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a copula in use in an equative sentence when the predicate is a nominal? The copula must be expressed in at least some equative sentences with predicate nominals but need not be obligatory in these constructions. Both verbal copulas and pro-copulas (e.g. demonstratives or personal pronouns that link the subject and predicate nominals) are relevant for this feature. Please note that adjectives are not included within the category of ‘nominals’ here.	verb, copula, clause, noun, auxiliary	predication, verb classification	particle, auxiliary, absence vs. presence	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB118	Are there serial verb constructions?	1: present, 0: absent						"This summary of serial verb constructions from [Haspelmath (2016: 296)](http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/Files/LL/Docments/Journals/17.3/LLN17.3-Haspelmath.pdf) serves as a good clarification: ""A serial verb construction is a monoclausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element linking them and with no predicate–argument relation between the verbs.""  Serial verbs are different from verb compounds, in that they are compositional: ""a serial verb construction must be a productive schematic CONSTRUCTION such that the meaning of a concrete construct can be determined on the basis of the meanings of its parts and the construction meaning. This means that non-compositional combinations of verbs do not fall within the definition."" By contrast, verbal compounds are lexicalized and often non-compositional.  Serial verb constructions are also defined in Grambank as different from clause-chaining. Clause chaining involves a series of verbs which are not inflected, and one verb which is (see [GB150](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB150)). A serial verb construction is defined using Haspelmath's definition above, but in addition where it is not an example of clause chaining (i.e. it is not true that there is an inflected verb and the other verbs are missing inflection).  It is however possible for a language to have both serial verb constructions and clause chaining.  Serial verb constructions are also different from light verb constructions, which are made up of a verbal element and a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb, jointly determining argument structure (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB123)).  'Verb' here refers to words that can be used as independent verbs in the language in question; but it is also best if they are dynamic verbs, as per the definition in Haspelmath (2016), 'Verbs are defined as dynamic event expressions that do not have special coding when used in predication function'. Serial verb constructions which are more restricted than that, such as only applying to stative verbs (e.g. a verb meaning 'good'), should not be counted as 1."	verb	predication	special construction	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB119	Can mood be marked by an inflecting word (‘auxiliary verb’)?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature covers all grammatical moods (the relationship between the referred event/state/action and other possible worlds, or speaker's attitude) and aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) elements that inflect (i.e. change form depending on person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These markers are often described as ‘auxiliary verbs’ in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels by some authors (such as STAMP morphemes (STAM = Subject-Tense-Aspect-Mood-Polarity) or inflecting pronouns). We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking.  While negation or interrogation can be considered as grammatical moods, they are not included in this feature.	auxiliary	TAM, mood, modality	auxiliary	Hedvig Skirgård
GB120	Can aspect be marked by an inflecting word (‘auxiliary verb’)?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature covers all grammatical aspects (internal temporal constitution of events/actions/states) and aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) elements that inflect (i.e. change form depending on person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These markers are often described as ‘auxiliary verbs’ in the literature, but they are also analyzed under other labels by some authors (such as STAMP morphemes (STAM = Subject-Tense-Aspect-Mood-Polarity) or inflecting pronouns). We are interested in grammatical marking, that is, [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking.	auxiliary	TAM, aspect	auxiliary	Hedvig Skirgård
GB121	Can tense be marked by an inflecting word (‘auxiliary verb’)?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature covers all tenses (present, past, and future) and aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) elements that inflect (i.e. change form depending on person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These markers are often described as ‘auxiliary verbs’ in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels by some authors (such as STAMP morphemes (STAM = Subject-Tense-Aspect-Mood-Polarity) or inflecting pronouns). We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking.	auxiliary	TAM, tense	auxiliary	Hedvig Skirgård
GB122	Is verb compounding a regular process?	1: present, 0: absent						Verbal compounds are lexicalized, often non-compositional, constructions which combine two or more verb stems.  Languages with [serial verb constructions](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118) can often have verb compounds too, however they might not always be described as such.	verb	predication, derivation	compounding	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB123	Are there verb-adjunct (aka light-verb) constructions?	1: present, 0: absent						A light-verb construction is a lexicalized complex predicate with two components: (1) a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb and (2) an inflectable verb, which is called the light verb. It is form-identical with a main verb, but used with a different meaning such that it ‘cannot be said to be predicating fully' (examples in English include _give a sigh_ or _take a plunge_) (Butt 2003).  Items that can occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions are: (1) nouns (e.g. *do baby* in Ivorian English or *have sex* in English for ‘to copulate’), (2) adjectives (e.g. *make beautiful* in English), (3) non-inflectable items such as ideophones (e.g. *do ssss* for ‘to make an ssss sound’), or (4) verbs borrowed from other languages that do not inflect in the target language.  Regular verbs cannot occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions, in the Grambank definition. This makes light verb constructions different from serial verb constructions and verbal compounding, which involve a sequence of more than one verb. Another difference is that there is a predicate-argument relationship between the light verb and the other lexical stem (e.g. in *do baby*, *baby* is the object of *do*), while in serial verb constructions the verbs do not have a predicate-argument relationship between them since they instead describe a sequence of events.	verb, noun	predication, derivation	special construction	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB124	Is incorporation of nouns into verbs a productive intransitivizing process?	1: present, 0: absent						Noun incorporation is defined as a construction where obligatorily bare (i.e. articleless, numberless, modifierless) nouns must occur adjacent to or inside of the verb, in a fixed order. This feature essentially asks whether transitive verbs may be rendered intransitive by means of noun incorporation, and whether this process is productive. This need not be the default way of intransitivizing verbs, but the process must be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity). The incorporated noun in the construction of interest for this feature is semantically an argument of the verb. For example: *he was painting the bike* = *he was bike-painting*. Noun incorporation where the relevant noun functions as an adjunct or modifier does not count, e.g. *she was running like Jacob runs* = *she was Jacob-running*. A construction where it is necessary to overtly represent the relevant argument with an additional form other than the incorporated noun, for example with a pronoun, also does not count.	verb, noun	valency change, valency decrease, derivation	incorporation, compounding	Hannah J. Haynie
GB126	Is there an existential verb?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there an element expressing existential predication (*A book on that topic **exists**.*/*There **is** a book on that topic.*), that is **different from the equative or attributive copula**? It is possible that there are various existential verbs making further distinctions, temporary versus permanent existence, or that there is a special negative existential verb. The existential marker can be used for the expression of other functions, such as aspect, as long as it is **not** identical to the copula of identity or attribution (as is the case with *is*, *That book **is** part of a series.* and *That book **is** great*). The existential element need not fulfill all formal criteria to qualify as a verb. The existence of a negative existential alone is not sufficient for a 1. Locational or positional verbs are also not enough for a 1.	verb, copula, auxiliary	verb classification, predication	particle, auxiliary, absence vs. presence	Hedvig Skirgård
GB127	Are different posture verbs used obligatorily depending on an inanimate locatum's shape or position (e.g. ‘to lie’ vs. ‘to stand’)?	1: present, 0: absent						In some languages, locative predication (‘X is at Y’) always requires the use of a posture verb (e.g. ‘X sits at Y’ vs. ‘X lies at Y’). The posture verb depends on the shape or the position of the item that is located. For example, a bottle may always ‘stand’ somewhere and a ball may always ‘lie’ somewhere.  In these languages, a speaker could not simply say that something ‘is’ somewhere. Some posture verbs that may occur in languages are verbs for sitting, standing, hanging and lying. Note that this feature does not concern morphological marking of position or shape, but the use of different verbs for this purpose. If the posture verbs are clearly dominant in frequency this is sufficient to count as obligatory for the purpose of this question, even if non-posture verb alternatives are grammatical.	verb	verb classification, nominal classification, predication	suppletion, conjugation	Jakob Lesage
GB129	Is there a notably small number of verb roots in the language?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature tracks languages with few members in the word class which is most commonly known as ‘verbs’. If the word class ‘verbs’ contains approximately 100 roots or less, the language qualifies for this feature.  A large part of the grammar may be devoted to constructions where a verb from the closed class combines with open-class items to form predicates in most sentences. If a grammar never remarks on the size of the verbal inventory this almost always means that the language does not have a small number of verbs in the sense of the present question. If a language has a small number of verbs in this sense, typically a description will say that there is a closed class of verbs with few members.  In such languages, it is typically the case that what is described by one verb in other languages is instead expressed by so called ‘light verb constructions’ (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB123)). For example, *do meeting* could express the meaning ‘to meet’. It is also possible for a language to have few verbs but no light-verb constructions.	verb	verb classification	inventory	Hedvig Skirgård
GB130	What is the pragmatically unmarked order of S and V in intransitive clauses?	multistate 1: SV; 2: VS; 3: both						This feature focuses on the relative order of subject and verb in intransitive clauses. All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider ‘left or right-dislocation’, accompanied by intonational signals, or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts. The position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored.	clause	predication	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB131	Is a pragmatically unmarked constituent order verb-initial for transitive clauses?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature focuses on the relative order of the verb and its [core arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) in a transitive clause. Any constituents other than the core arguments (A, P) and the verb of a transitive clause should be ignored. All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider ‘left or right-dislocation’, accompanied by intonational signals or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts. The position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored.	clause	predication	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB132	Is a pragmatically unmarked constituent order verb-medial for transitive clauses?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature focuses on the relative order of the verb and its [core arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) in a transitive clause. Any constituents other than the core arguments (A, P) and the verb of a transitive clause should be ignored. All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider ‘left or right-dislocation’, accompanied by intonational signals or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts. The position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored.	clause	predication	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB133	Is a pragmatically unmarked constituent order verb-final for transitive clauses?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature focuses on the relative order of the verb and its [core arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) in a transitive clause. Any constituents other than the core arguments (A, P) and the verb of a transitive clause should be ignored. All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider ‘left or right-dislocation', accompanied by intonational signals or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts. The position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored.	clause	predication	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB134	Is the order of constituents the same in main and subordinate clauses?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature focuses on whether the basic word order(s) of main clauses are possible in subordinate clauses. A ‘yes’ response for this feature indicates that subjects, verbs, and objects occur in the same order in subordinate clauses as in main clauses. For example, the order between ‘woman’, ‘man’, and ‘chases’ is the same in the simple clause *the woman chases the man* as in the subordinate clause of *I think that the woman chases the man* in English, and this feature asks if it is the same in target languages. In languages with flexible word order it is sufficient for a 1 if all pragmatically unmarked main clause orders are possible in subordinate clauses, even if there are additional word order alternatives in subordinate clauses that are not available in main clauses. Subordinate clauses involving reported speech (e.g. *He said that the woman chases the man.*) should be disregarded.	clause	predication, subordination	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB135	Do clausal objects usually occur in the same position as nominal objects?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature involves a comparison of the word order in transitive clauses with nominal objects with order in clauses with clausal objects. By clausal objects here we mean clauses that are directly governed by a finite verb (typically verbs of ‘wanting’, ‘saying’, etc.). In other words, complement clauses are a specific type of subordinate clauses and are not relative clauses. For example, the objects in _I like **apples**_ (nominal object) and _I like **that you play the piano every morning**_ (clausal object) are in the same position (SVO). Many of the languages that do not place clausal objects in the same position as nominal objects are SOV languages that use SVO order for (long) clausal objects. This question aims to discern whether these clausal objects are treated like prototypical nominal direct objects (not indirect or obliques). This is not always explicitly stated by the descriptive work, but an investigation into the examples and perhaps even appended text of the grammar should typically reveals evidence for answering this question.	clause	predication, subordination	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB136	Is the order of core argument (i.e. S, A, and P) constituents fixed?	1: present, 0: absent						The order of core arguments is fixed if you cannot permute the order of core constituents (S, A, and P) and the verb without either i) changing the propositional content of the clause or ii) requiring intonational signaling or further elements (particles, cleft components, adjuncts).	clause	predication	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB137	Can standard negation be marked clause-finally?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature refers to standard negation, or the construction(s) that mark negation of (at least) dynamic (i.e. non-stative) verbal predicates in declarative mood. It is possible that the same negation construction will be used for other purposes as well (e.g. with stative or non-verbal predicates), but clauses involving predicates other than the aforementioned dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood should be disregarded.  The position ‘clause-final’ includes [suffixes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) on verbs in verb-final clauses, even if they are not the very last suffix on the verb. Prefixes on clause-final verbs do not count as clause-final negation. If a negator consists of two obligatory elements and only one is clause-final, this is sufficient to count as clause-final marking and trigger a 1 for this feature. As with other word order features in this dataset, we are concerned with the order of the negative marker when the clause has its canonical intransitive or transitive word order. We are not interested in cases of argument omission or pragmatically marked constructions (e.g. focus); these should be disregarded in coding this feature.	particle, clause, verb	TAM, negation	conjugation, word order, particle	Hannah J. Haynie
GB138	Can standard negation be marked clause-initially?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature focuses on standard negation, or the construction(s) that mark negation of (at least) dynamic (i.e. non-stative) verbal predicates in declarative mood. It is possible that the same negation construction will be used for other purposes as well (e.g. with stative or non-verbal predicates), but clauses involving predicates other than the aforementioned dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood should be disregarded.  The position ‘clause-initial’ includes [prefixes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) on clause-initial verbs, even if the negator is not the left-most prefix, but suffixes on clause-initial verbs do not count as clause-initial negation. If the negator consists of two obligatory elements and only one is clause-initial, this is sufficient to count as clause-initial negation and to trigger a 1 for this feature. As with other word order features in this dataset, we are concerned with the order of the negative marker when the clause has its canonical intransitive or transitive word order. We are not interested in cases of argument omission or pragmatically marked constructions (e.g. focus); these should be disregarded in coding this feature.	particle, clause, verb	TAM, negation	conjugation, word order, particle	Hannah J. Haynie
GB139	Is there a difference between imperative (prohibitive) and declarative negation constructions?	1: present, 0: absent						Is the negative construction for declarative negation (e.g. *I don't drink.*) different from the negative imperative (e.g. *don't drink!*). This feature covers more than only different negators: a different order, loss of finiteness or the addition of new elements also count as differences. If a language-specific analysis indicates two different constructions for negative imperative and prohibitive, then we are only concerned with the construction that negates the traditional imperative function here.	particle, clause, verb	TAM, mood, imperative, prohibition, negation	conjugation, word order, particle	Hedvig Skirgård
GB140	Is verbal predication marked by the same negator as all of the following types of predication: locational, existential and nominal?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature pertains only to the negative marker itself, be it an independent particle, verb, auxiliary, clitic or affix. This feature covers three kinds of non-verbal negation: locational (*The dog is not in the kitchen.*), existential (*Hogwarts does not exist.*) or nominal predication (*Ursula is not a witch.*).	particle, clause, verb, copula	predication, negation, verb classification	particle, conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB146	Is there a morpho-syntactic distinction between predicates expressing controlled versus uncontrolled events or states?	1: present, 0: absent						In a number of languages, predicates referring to uncontrolled events or states happening to animate participants are encoded differently from those that refer to controlled events. Often, such a distinction surfaces in predicates referring to sensations (such as hunger, thirst, pain, cold, cramps, sleepiness, etc.), emotions (anger, happiness), or cognitive states (forgetting, remembering). These uncontrolled predicates may be found in specialized constructions, including different case frames (‘sleep hits me’), special conjugation classes of verbs or adjectives, dedicated (modal) markers for control vs. non-control, etc. Other terms that may be used in the literature are non-volitional, non-agentive, non-volitive or involuntary. Note that we are not interested in how stative events with *inanimate* experiencers are coded: their coding is irrelevant, whether they show distinctions with controlled events or states or not. The existence of verbal derivations such as passive or causative does not count here. At least three different predicates should show a special kind of construction to code 1 for this feature.	clause, verb, adjective, noun, case marker, NP	control, argument marking, core, oblique, verb classification	special construction, flagging, indexing, conjugation, declension	Jakob Lesage
GB147	Is there a morphological passive marked on the lexical verb?	1: present, 0: absent						Passivization is a detransitivizing operation that takes a transitive clause (*The dog bites the man.*) and turns it into an intransitive clause by promoting the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the man*) to morphosyntactic [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) function. In the resulting intransitive clause, the former [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the dog*) either vanishes or adopts an oblique function: *The man is bitten (by the dog).* ‘Mediopassives’, ‘anticausatives’ and the sort (e.g. ‘x breaks the vase’ > ‘the vase breaks’) also count as passives. This question targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) passive markers on lexical verbs. Anything that happens with auxiliaries is irrelevant here.	verb	valency change, passive, derivation, valency decrease	derivational morphology	Jakob Lesage
GB148	Is there a morphological antipassive marked on the lexical verb?	1: present, 0: absent						An antipassive marker detransitivizes verbs by removing the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument or realizing it as an oblique argument. In a construction with ergative alignment, this means that the [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument of a transitive clause is encoded as the [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument in a corresponding antipassive clause. An antipassive marker often also has other detransitivizing functions, such as reflexivization, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative.  In practice, this feature targets any intransitivising marker that is not, or not only, a reflexive, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative marker. This question targets productive [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) antipassive markers on lexical verbs, as well as reduplication. Zero-marking or the removal of a transitivizing marker is not sufficient for a 1. Anything that happens with auxiliaries is irrelevant here. If the antipassive marker is only applied in a limited set of probably lexicalized items, it does not trigger 1.	verb	valency change, antipassive, derivation, valency decrease	derivational morphology	Jakob Lesage
GB149	Is there a morphologically marked inverse on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent						Inverse systems are based on an animacy, person, or topicality hierarchy. Inverse markers indicate that the patient outranks the agent on the hierarchy. In a system that has a hierarchy [speech act participants > 3SG pronouns > humans > animals, etc.], for example, ‘man INV-bite dog’ would mean ‘the dog bit the man’. Note that in some languages, there are portmanteau morphemes that both function as person [indexes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) on verbs and as direct/inverse markers. They would trigger 1 for this question. This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) inverse markers.	verb, index	argument marking, core	conjugation	Jakob Lesage
GB150	Is there clause chaining?	1: present, 0: absent						Clause-chaining involves sequences of medial clauses (i.e. formally reduced or restricted clauses that do not have the full marking that usually occurs on the verb) which are dependent on a single, fully inflected verb that often (but not always) occurs in final clause. Clause chains may also be referred to as topic chains or as sequences of medial clauses/medial verbs. Crucially, this construction involves a single clause with a full, unrestricted, finite verb form and several medial clauses that are dependent on it for specification of inflectional categories (e.g. TAM).  Clause chains are often used to describe sequences of events, and the medial verbs involved may be marked by [special affixes to indicate temporal relationships](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB152). Clause chains may also include markers of [switch reference](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB151). Medial verbs in some languages may be marked in the usual way for person/number of their arguments, though they generally lack some other canonical verbal inflection or involve specific marked verb forms that cannot be used in freestanding clauses.  There is considerable debate regarding the syntax of clause chaining generally and within individual languages. This construction is not merely a series of juxtaposed minimal clauses, as it requires dependency on one clause for full interpretation. It is also not straightforwardly a series of subordinated clauses (as in the series of temporal adjuncts in English, *Before he ate, while he was cooking the soup, he added salt.*). The syntactic relationship between clauses in clause chains is often described as a special type of coordination or a form of cosubordination.  In some cases clause-chaining may be difficult to distinguish from [serial verb constructions](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118). Remember that a serial verb construction involves a set of verbs or verb phrases that function as a single predicate, whereas clause-chaining involves a set of *clauses* with formally reduced verbs, all dependent on a single fully specified verb form. Clause-chaining is also different from [verb compounding](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) in that the clauses in clause chaining are [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) and express separate propositions, which is not the case for verb compounding. In cases where it is unclear which of these constructions is represented by the examples in the grammar, a ? may be coded, but be sure to indicate in the comments that you were unable to determine which of these constructions is demonstrated in the relevant examples.	verb, clause	predication	special construction	Hannah J. Haynie
GB151	Is there an overt verb marker dedicated to signaling coreference or noncoreference between the subject of one clause and an argument of an adjacent clause (‘switch reference’)?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there an overt marker [on the verb](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27) that marks whether the argument has the same/a different referent as/than an argument of the following clause? Some languages (e.g. Kashaya) signal switch reference by using different allomorphs of TAM markers depending on whether the subject of the following clause is the same or different. Some systems (e.g. Southeastern Pomo) only have special morphology to indicate different subjects, whereas the contrasting morphological pattern that is used for coreferential subjects can also be used for some combinations of clauses with different referents.	verb, clause, index	deixis, argument marking, core	conjugation, indexing	Hannah J. Haynie
GB152	Is there a morphologically marked distinction between simultaneous and sequential clauses?	1: present, 0: absent						This question is concerned with whether there is an overt marker dedicated to signaling the distinction between temporally simultaneous and sequential actions. If sequential meaning is a secondary function of an imperfective aspect this does not count; it must be indicated by a devoted marker. The language does not need to express both sequential and simultaneous temporal relationships overtly; one marker devoted to either function is sufficient to trigger a 1.	verb, clause	TAM, sequentiality, simultaneity	conjugation	Hannah J. Haynie
GB155	Are causatives formed by affixes or clitics on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent						A causative is a valency increasing operation that introduces a causer core argument that makes a non-subject argument do or become something (e.g. ‘x eats’ -> ‘y feeds x’ = ‘y causes x to to eat’). Note that both causatives adding an argument to a transitive clause (*I drink milk* -> *x causes me to drink milk*) and those adding an argument to an intransitive clause (*I sit* -> *x causes me to sit*) are targeted by this question. This question targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) causative markers. Lexicalized causative verbs should be disregarded for this feature.	verb	causative, valency change, derivation, valency increase	affixation, derivational morphology	Jakob Lesage
GB156	Is there a causative construction involving an element that is unmistakably grammaticalized from a verb for ‘to say’?	1: present, 0: absent						A causative is a valency increasing operation that introduces a causer subject that makes a non-subject argument do or become something (e.g. ‘x eats’ -> ‘y feeds x’ = ‘y causes x to to eat’). Both causatives adding an argument to a transitive clause (*I drink milk* -> *x causes me to drink milk*) and those adding an argument to an intransitive clause (*I sit -> x causes me to sit*) are included in this feature. This question targets causative constructions with an element that clearly originated as a verb for ‘to say’ (e.g. *I said for the stone to fall* to mean ‘I made the stone fall’). Various verbs of saying count for this feature, including ‘to say’, ‘to speak’ and ‘to call’. If another verb is involved that cannot be easily translated as ‘to say’, e.g. ‘ask’, code 0 but mention the verb in the comments.	verb, auxiliary, particle	causative, valency change, derivation, valency increase	special construction, derivational morphology	Jakob Lesage
GB158	Are verbs reduplicated?	1: present, 0: absent						A verb is reduplicated if its root is fully or partially repeated. The word class of the outcome of the process is not relevant, as long as the root is a verb. Full repetition of already inflected verbs or units larger than a root does not trigger a 1 for this feature. This feature only targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) reduplication. Reduplication in closed classes (e.g. only a small, closed conjugation class) is not relevant. Lexicalized examples are irrelevant.	verb	derivation	reduplication	Jakob Lesage
GB159	Are nouns reduplicated?	1: present, 0: absent						A noun is reduplicated if its root is fully or partially repeated. The word class of the outcome of the process is not relevant, as long as the root is a noun. Full repetition of already inflected nouns or units larger than a root does not trigger a 1 for this feature. This feature only targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) reduplication. Reduplication in closed classes (e.g. kinship terms) is not relevant. Lexicalized examples are irrelevant.	noun	derivation	reduplication	Jakob Lesage
GB160	Are elements apart from verbs or nouns reduplicated?	1: present, 0: absent						A lexeme is reduplicated if its root is fully or partially repeated. The word class of the outcome of the process is not relevant, as long as the root is not a noun or a verb. Reduplication of function words counts, as does reduplication of numerals, adjectives and adverbs. Full repetition of already inflected words or units larger than a root does not trigger a 1 for this feature. This feature only targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) reduplication. Lexicalized examples are irrelevant. For open word classes, this means that reduplication should not be limited to a small set of lexically determined roots. For closed word classes, any transparent reduplication counts as long as the non-reduplicated root is also still used. Roots that only occur in their reduplicated form should be considered lexicalized reduplications.	adjective, ideophone, adverb	derivation	reduplication	Jakob Lesage
GB165	Is there a productive morphological trial marker on nouns?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of trial number on nouns. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB319 Is trial number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB319) which focuses on the non-bound marking of trial number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.  Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.  It can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.  The trial marker may be similar to the numeral for ‘three’, but it is crucial that it is used in a similar morphosyntactic manner to other number markers in the language.	noun	number	declension	Hedvig Skirgård
GB166	Is there a productive morphological paucal marker on nouns?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of paucal number on nouns (From Latin _paucalis_ ‘few, little’). Paucal is a number value that refers to a non-specified small amount usually between two or more and ten or less. The exact value can depend on what is being counted. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB320 Is paucal number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB320) which focuses on the non-bound marking of paucal number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.  Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class.

If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.	noun	number	declension	Hedvig Skirgård
GB167	Is there a logophoric pronoun?	1: present, 0: absent						Logophoric pronouns are used to distinguish reference to an individual whose speech or thought or feeling is being reported, as opposed to other third-person referents. Unsurprisingly, then, logophoric pronouns are found in reported speech contexts. This question concerns the existence of a special pronoun that specifically refers to the speaker/thinker/feeler in a reported speech construction. This special pronominal form occurs commonly in the complement clause of a speech or thought verb to designate the speaker/thinker/feeler (who is often also the subject of the speech/thought verb) as its referent.	pronoun	logophoricity, deixis, argument marking, core	declension, paradigm	Hannah J. Haynie
GB170	Can an adnominal property word agree with the noun in noun class/gender?	1: present, 0: absent						For this feature, we are interested in [noun classes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) (classes which nouns belong to based on properties such as gender, animacy, or shape and can be identified through [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with a modifier). We are not looking at noun classifiers (classifiers classify the noun and occur independently from other elements). This feature asks whether adjectives (defined semantically as ‘adnominal property words’) show agreement with the noun class/gender of nouns they modify. This should be true for [more than a small class of semantically restricted adjectives](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity); English ‘blond’ vs. ‘blonde’ for example would not be enough to answer 1 for the question.	adjective, NP	gender, attribution	agreement, declension	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB171	Can an adnominal demonstrative agree with the noun in noun class/gender?	1: present, 0: absent						For this feature, we are interested in [noun classes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) (classes which nouns belong to based on properties such as gender, animacy, or shape and can be identified through [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with a modifier). We are not looking at noun classifiers (classifiers classify the noun and occur independently from other elements). Demonstratives are adnominal modifiers that mark position. This feature asks whether demonstratives can agree in gender/noun class with their head noun, whether or not the head noun is overtly marked for gender/noun class.	demonstrative, NP	gender, attribution, deixis	agreement, declension	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB172	Can an article agree with the noun in noun class/gender?	1: present, 0: absent						For this feature, we are interested in [noun classes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) (classes which nouns belong to based on properties such as gender, animacy, or shape and can be identified through [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with a modifier). We are not looking at noun classifiers (classifiers classify the noun and occur independently from other elements). Articles can agree in gender/noun class with the head noun even if the head noun is not overtly marked for gender/noun class. This feature concerns both definite and indefinite articles. Features [GB020](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB020) and [GB021](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB021) both concern the absence or presence of definite and indefinite articles, please consider those features if you have coded 1 for this feature.	article, NP, demonstrative	gender, deixis, definiteness	agreement, declension	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB177	Can the verb carry a marker of animacy of argument, unrelated to any noun class/gender of the argument visible in the NP domain?	1: present, 0: absent						Does the animacy of an argument ([S or A or P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P))) determine the form or presence of an [index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) on the verb. This system of marking needs to be unrelated to or not reducible to the [gender/noun class system](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) as revealed by [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) in the noun phrase.	verb, index	nominal classification, predication	agreement, conjugation	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB184	Can an adnominal property word agree with the noun in number?	1: present, 0: absent						Adnominal property words semantically roughly correspond to adjectives in languages that have a separate adjective class. The property word can agree in number with the head noun even if the head noun is not overtly marked for number.	adjective, NP	number, attribution	agreement, declension	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB185	Can an adnominal demonstrative agree with the noun in number?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns adnominal demonstratives (not pronominal demonstratives) and whether they can agree in number with the head noun. Number marking on demonstratives counts as agreement even if the head noun is not overtly marked for number.	demonstrative, NP	number, attribution, deixis	agreement, declension	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB186	Can an article agree with the noun in number?	1: present, 0: absent						An article is a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity and (in)definiteness. When an article is marked for number, this counts as agreement even if the head noun is not overtly marked for number. This includes both definite and indefinite articles.	article, NP, demonstrative	number, deixis, definiteness	agreement, declension	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB187	Is there any productive diminutive marking on the noun (exclude marking by system of nominal classification only)?	1: present, 0: absent						Diminutive marking encodes smaller size. This marker must be [phonologically bound to the noun](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). The marker may also encode other meanings but needs to minimally encode smaller size. Reduplication and stem changes count. This needs to be a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) pattern.	noun	nominalization, diminutive, derivation	derivational morphology	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB188	Is there any productive augmentative marking on the noun (exclude marking by system of nominal classification only)?	1: present, 0: absent						Augmentative marking generally intensifies the noun (in various ways). To code 1, the marker needs to minimally encode a large size of the noun it is attached to. This needs to be a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) pattern.	noun	nominalization, augmentative, derivation	derivational morphology	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB192	Is there a noun class/gender system where a noun’s phonological properties are a factor in class assignment?	1: present, 0: absent						A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the phonological properties of a noun constitute one of these factors for a given language. For this feature to be coded 1, there must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of specific phonological properties. That is, some phonological property of a noun must be one relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. Examples of phonological properties that may play a role in gender/class assignment include tone, initial consonants, or root-final segments. Note that noun class/gender morphology may create phonological similarities across members of a certain noun class or gender; however, this is not sufficient for a 1 coding for this feature. Phonological properties must contribute to the categorization of nouns to classes/genders, rather than simply result from associated morphology.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah J. Haynie
GB193	What is the order of adnominal property word and noun?	multistate 1: ANM - N; 2: N - ANM; 3: both; 0: they cannot be used attributively						Adnominal property words are called adjectives in those languages where they make up a separate word class. We want to include elements that mark ‘adjectival’ function but that might not be described as ‘adjectives’, see [GB069](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB069). The question concerns the pragmatically neutral order(s).	adjective, NP	attribution	word order	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB196	Is there a masculine/feminine distinction in phonologically independent second person pronouns?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature asks whether the [phonologically independent pronoun](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) forms used for second persons differ for masculine and feminine referents. This masculine/feminine distinction is a minimal contrast required for the coding of this feature, but other gender categories may also be encoded in second person pronoun forms. Pronoun systems that encode other grammatical gender/noun class categories in second person forms in the absence of a masculine/feminine distinction are not sufficient to satisfy this criterion. Languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature will include a distinction between masculine and feminine forms in at least some categories of second person independent pronouns, but possibly not all categories. In many languages this contrast occurs only in the singular pronouns; that is, there is a contrast between masculine and feminine forms for second person singular, but not for second person plural (or dual, or any other non-singular number category). In some languages there is a contrast in multiple number categories, including singular and some non-singular number categories. It is uncommon for a language to have a masculine/feminine contrast in non-singular second person pronouns but not in the singular pronouns. However such languages would also satisfy the criteria for this feature. For more information on the difference between grammatical gender and social, cultural, and biological constructs or traits, see the [gender wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Grammatical-gender-and-other-notions-of-gender).	pronoun	gender	declension, paradigm	Hannah J. Haynie
GB197	Is there a masculine/feminine distinction in phonologically independent first person pronouns?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature asks whether the [phonologically independent pronoun](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) forms used for first person differ for masculine and feminine referents. This masculine/feminine distinction is a minimal contrast required for the coding of this feature, but other gender categories may also be encoded in a language’s first person pronoun forms. Pronoun systems that encode other grammatical gender/noun class categories in first person forms in the absence of a masculine/feminine distinction are not sufficient to satisfy this criterion. Languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature will include a distinction between masculine and feminine forms in at least some categories of first person independent pronouns, but possibly not all categories. In many languages this contrast occurs only in the singular pronouns; that is, there is a contrast between masculine and feminine forms for first person singular, but not for first person plural (or dual, or any other non-singular number category). In some languages there is a relevant contrast in multiple number categories, including singular and some non-singular number categories. It is uncommon for a language to have a masculine/feminine contrast in non-singular first person pronouns but not in the singular pronouns. However, such languages also satisfy the criteria for this feature. For more information on the difference between grammatical gender and social, cultural, and biological constructs or traits, see the [gender wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Grammatical-gender-and-other-notions-of-gender).	pronoun	gender	declension, paradigm	Hannah J. Haynie
GB198	Can an adnominal numeral agree with the noun in noun class/gender?	1: present, 0: absent						For this feature, we are interested in [noun classes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) (classes which nouns belong to based upon properties such as gender, animacy, or shape and can be identified through [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with a modifier). We are not looking at noun classifiers ([GB057](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB057)) (classifiers classify the noun and occur independently from other elements). This feature asks whether adnominal numerals show agreement with the gender of nouns they modify. This system of agreement should be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity).	numeral, NP	quantification, attribution, gender	agreement, declension	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB203	What is the order of the adnominal collective universal quantifier (‘all’) and the noun?	0: no UQ, 1: UQ-N, 2: N-UQ, 3: both						This feature is concerned with the ordering of a universal quantifier (‘all’) and the noun. As with other word order features in this database, this is focused specifically on adnominal quantification in pragmatically unmarked contexts. In languages that do not have a distinction between collective and distributive universal quantifiers (‘all’ vs. ‘every’), a quantifier that could be translated as ‘all’ and has a primarily plural use will be a sufficient target for this feature.  There are four possible codes for this feature, reflecting the fact that the collective universal quantifier might occur strictly before or strictly after the noun, may be allowed in both of these relative positions, or may not be present in a language. A 0 code is also applicable when the language does not allow a basic construction with an adnominal collective universal quantifier and a noun (e.g. if only a floating construction is used).  Orders that result from constructions like quantifier float (e.g. English *The children have **all** come.*) should be disregarded for the purposes of coding this feature.	quantifier, NP	quantification, attribution	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB204	Do collective (‘all’) and distributive (‘every’) universal quantifiers differ in their forms or their syntactic positions?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature identifies languages that use different forms or syntactic positions for collective universal quantification (e.g. English *all*) versus distributive universal quantification (e.g. English *every*). This contrasts with languages that use both the same form *and* the same word order for these two types of quantification.	quantifier, NP	quantification, attribution	word order, declension, paradigm	Hannah J. Haynie
GB250	Can predicative possession be expressed with a transitive ‘habeo’ verb?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and a possessum. For this feature, we are looking for a verb that expresses predicative possession where the possessor is the subject, the possessum the object and the verb is finite and clearly transitive. The finite element in itself need not be clearly distinct from an existential or locational predicator, the main difference is the argument structure.  Transitivity is a language-specific category that needs to be investigated separately to learn whether or not the construction is transitive. In case of languages where transitivity is hard to define it might be beneficial to compare to verbs of holding and grasping. It is very likely that habeo-verb constructions arise from possessive constructions where the possessor is expressed as a topic.	verb, clause	verb classification, predicative possession, predication	auxiliary	Hedvig Skirgård
GB252	Can predicative possession be expressed with an S-like possessum and a locative-coded possessor?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and possessum. This feature is concerned with clauses where the possessum is the subject of an existential/locative predicate and the possessor is in an oblique form marked by an element meaning ‘at/in/on’ (e.g. *the car is on me* to mean ‘I have a car.’ or ‘The car is mine.’). The possessor-NP need not be overtly marked for location, it can be expressed in the verb itself, e.g. with a locative extension.  This type of predicative possession construction is known as the ‘locational possessive’ in the work of Stassen (2001, 2013).	verb, clause, NP, case marker, adposition, index	predication, predicative possession, argument marking, oblique, locative	flagging, indexing	Hedvig Skirgård
GB253	Can predicative possession be expressed with an S-like possessum and a dative-coded possessor?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and possessum. This feature concerns clauses where the possessum is the subject of an existential predicate and the possessor is coded as an oblique argument, marked by an element meaning ‘to/for’ or by a dative marker (e.g. *car is to me*, *car is for me*, meaning ‘The car is mine’, or ‘I have a car’). The possessor-NP need not be marked for dative case. The dative meaning can be expressed on the verb itself, e.g. with a benefactive extension.  This type of predicative possession construction is known as the ‘dative possessive’, a subcategory of the ‘locational possessive’, in the work of Stassen (2000, 2001, 2003).	verb, clause, NP, case marker, adposition, index	predication, predicative possession, argument marking, oblique, dative	flagging, indexing	Hedvig Skirgård
GB254	Can predicative possession be expressed with an S-like possessum and a possessor that is coded like an adnominal possessor?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and possessum. This feature concerns clauses where the possessum is the subject and the possessor is construed as a modifier of the possessum (e.g. *my car exists* to mean ‘I have a car’).  This type of predicative possessive construction is known as the ‘genitive possessive’ in the work of Stassen (2001, 2013).	verb, clause, NP, case marker, adposition, index	predication, predicative possession, argument marking, oblique, genitive	flagging, indexing	Hedvig Skirgård
GB256	Can predicative possession be expressed with a comitative/conjunctional construction?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and a possessum. This feature concerns a clause which features a comitative/conjunctional construction (c.f. Stassen 2000, 2001, 2013). The predicate is an existential/locational/copula and the possessum or possessor is marked by an element marking simultaneity between clauses, or ‘also/too’, or subordinating conjunction (‘when/while’), or coordinating particle (‘and’), or a comitative marker (‘with’). The marker need not be [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). Both constructions where the possessor and constructions where the possessum is marked by the comitative marker count.	verb, clause, NP, case marker, adposition, index	predication, predicative possession, argument marking, oblique, comitative	flagging, indexing	Hedvig Skirgård
GB257	Can polar interrogation be marked by intonation only?	1: present, 0: absent						For this feature, we are looking for polar interrogation marked by intonation, and it should be the only marker in that construction. However, it does not have to be the only construction in the language which can mark polar interrogation. Intonation is our focus and not tone. Intonation is different from tonal marking. Tonal marking is bound to a certain position in the clause (e.g. the final syllable, or a certain constituent). Intonation concerns the whole clause and will have a variation in pitch across sentences and phrases.	verb, clause, sentence	mood, interrogation	intonation	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB260	Can polar interrogation be indicated by a special word order?	1: present, 0: absent						Can a change in word order mark polar questions? In order for a construction to trigger 1, there should be no other marker in the clause that signals polar interrogation, not even lack of finiteness compared to the affirmative.  This excludes intonation, which may be different between questions and declarative statements.	verb, clause, sentence	mood, interrogation	word order	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB262	Is there a clause-initial polar interrogative particle?	1: present, 0: absent						"In this feature, we are looking for a polar interrogative [particle](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles) that appears at the beginning of the clause. The particle should be dedicated to marking questions that ask for the equivalent of an affirmative or negative answer (as opposed to content questions).  Dryer (2013) distinguishes **neutral** questions from **leading** questions in the paragraph quoted below. This feature in Grambank concerns neutral questions:  ""Many languages have question particles or expressions that indicate that the question is a leading question, one where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. English, for example, employs what are called ""tag-questions"" for this purpose, illustrated in (13a), which differ from the neutral question form illustrated in (13b) in that its form indicates that the speaker expects a ‘yes’ answer.  13a. You’re planning to go to the beach, aren’t you?  13b. Are you planning to go to the beach?"""	verb, clause, particle	mood, interrogation	particle, word order	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB263	Is there a clause-final polar interrogative particle?	1: present, 0: absent						"In this feature, we are looking for a polar interrogative [particle](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles) which appears at the end of the clause. The particle should be dedicated to marking questions that ask for the equivalent of an affirmative or negative answer (as opposed to content questions). This particle does not have to be obligatory, and it is sufficient if the particle does not always appear in clause-final position.  Dryer (2013) distinguishes **neutral** questions from **leading** questions in the paragraph quoted below. This feature in Grambank concerns neutral questions.  ""Many languages have question particles or expressions that indicate that the question is a leading question, one where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be.

GB264	Is there a polar interrogative particle that most commonly occurs neither clause-initially nor clause-finally?	1: present, 0: absent						"Is there a [particle](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles) that is dedicated to marking questions that ask for the equivalent of a 'yes’ or 'no’ answer (as opposed to content questions) that most commonly occurs in the middle of the clause, neither initially nor finally?  (definition from Dryer 2013b).  [Dryer (2013a)](https://wals.info/chapter/92) distinguishes **neutral** questions from **leading** questions, and this feature in Grambank concerns neutral questions:  ""Many languages have question particles or expressions that indicate that the question is a leading question, one where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. English, for example, employs what are called ""tag-questions"" for this purpose, illustrated in (13a), which differ from the neutral question form illustrated in (13b) in that its form indicates that the speaker expects a ‘yes’ answer.  13a.

GB265	Is there a comparative construction that includes a form that elsewhere means ‘surpass, exceed’?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature identifies languages that have a comparative construction that involves a form (usually a verb form) meaning ‘surpass’ or ‘exceed’. Typically, the standard of comparison is the direct object, the object of comparison is the subject, and there are two predicates: one expressing ‘surpass/exceed’, and one carrying relevant lexical information about the property under comparison (e.g. *Ronald exceed be-tall Julia.*, meaning ‘Ronald is taller than Julia.’).  Though this typical structure is quite common in languages that have a ‘surpass/exceed’ comparative construction, only the use of a ‘surpass/exceed' form is required for this feature; it is not necessary for the standard to occur as a direct object or the thing being compared to serve as the subject in order to trigger a 1 value. The order of these predicates is not relevant for this feature, nor whether the property word is a verb or an adjective. The predicate expressing ‘surpass/exceed’ must also have functions besides comparison.	verb, auxiliary, particle, clause, adjective	comparison, predication	auxiliary, particle	Hannah J. Haynie
GB266	Is there a comparative construction that employs a marker of the standard which elsewhere has a locational meaning?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature identifies comparative constructions that mark the standard of comparison with an element that is otherwise locational or benefactive in meaning. In these constructions a marker that also has a locational (or benefactive) function is invariably found in the standard NP. Please note that benefactive markers are included here, following Stassen’s (1984, 1985) category of locational comparatives. The marker of the property word is irrelevant for this feature (e.g. the English *-er* suffix, as in *tall-er*).	verb, particle, clause, adjective, adposition	comparison, predication, argument marking, oblique, locative	flagging, indexing	Hannah J. Haynie
GB270	Can comparatives be expressed using two conjoined clauses?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a comparative construction comprised of two conjoined clauses? Specifically, this construction must involve two conjoined clauses, one containing the standard of comparison and one containing the object of comparison, with no additional, obligatory, special markers of comparison (e.g. English *than*, or *surpass/exceed*). The NPs expressing the standard and object of comparison typically have the same function in the clauses. Note that many languages can juxtapose clauses (e.g. English *She is nice and he is not nice.*), however these sorts of constructions should only be considered for this feature when they are a dedicated way of expressing comparative meaning (e.g. when the structure clearly has a meaning like, ‘She is nicer than he is.’). In other words, we are focused on languages that have a dedicated comparative construction involving conjoined clauses.	verb, clause, adjective, sentence	comparison, predication	special construction	Hannah J. Haynie
GB273	Is there a comparative construction with a standard marker that elsewhere has neither a locational meaning nor a ‘surpass/exceed’ meaning?	1: present, 0: absent						This question is focused on comparative constructions that have a dedicated marker for the standard of comparison that does not fall under the umbrella of the locational comparative ([GB266](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB266)) or surpass/exceed comparative ([GB265](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB265)). Note that a language may have multiple comparative constructions, including a non-locational, non-surpass/exceed comparative as well as constructions that are described by those features.  Crucially, the dedicated marker in this construction must not elsewhere have a surpass/exceed meaning or a locational meaning. It may, however, have other functions (e.g. temporal adverb, conjunction, etc.). It is irrelevant whether this marker is [phonologically free or not](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) or whether it triggers [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) in case, noun class, etc.  Historically, comparative constructions with dedicated markers (sometimes called ‘particle comparatives’) grammaticalize from constructions of conjoined clauses. An example of a particle comparative would be the Germanic languages, such as English *than*. Note that any marking of the property word is not relevant here (e.g. English *tall-er*).	verb, auxiliary, particle, clause, adjective, adposition	comparison, predication	flagging, indexing	Hannah J. Haynie
GB275	Is there a bound comparative degree marker on the property word in a comparative construction?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature focuses on the presence of a bound marker of comparative degree on the property word in a comparative construction (e.g. *-er* in English *tall-er*). We specifically focus on comparative constructions where the standard of comparison is overtly expressed (e.g. *Maria is taller than John.*) but also count clearly comparative forms where the standard of comparison is null/implied/inferred from context (e.g. *Maria is taller.*) This feature requires the degree marker to be [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) to the property word.	adjective, clause	comparison, predication	declension, conjugation, special construction	Hannah J. Haynie
GB276	Is there a non-bound comparative degree marker modifying the property word in a comparative construction?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature focuses on the presence of a [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) marker of comparative degree that modifies the property word in a comparative construction (e.g. French ***plus** grand*). We specifically focus on comparative constructions where the standard of comparison is overtly expressed (e.g. meanings like ‘Maria is taller than John’) but also count clearly comparative forms where the standard of comparison is null/implied/inferred from the context (e.g. meanings like ‘Maria is taller’). The comparative constructions of interest express superiority (as in the French and English examples above), not inferiority (e.g. meanings like ‘John is less athletic than Maria’).  This feature requires that the degree marker modify the property word. It should not be phonologically bound.	adjective, clause, particle	comparison, predication	particle, special construction	Hannah J. Haynie
GB285	Can polar interrogation be marked by a question particle and verbal morphology?	1: present, 0: absent						For this feature, we are looking for polar interrogation marked by a question [particle](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles) and verbal [morphology](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). These should be the only two markers in the construction. However, this does not have to be the only construction in the language which can mark polar interrogation. Nominalizers also count as verbal morphology for the purpose of this question. Tone does not count as a particle here. The intonation of the clause is not relevant to this question. It may be the same as or different from declarative clauses.	verb, clause, particle	mood, interrogation	particle, conjugation	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB286	Can polar interrogation be indicated by overt verbal morphology only?	1: present, 0: absent						In order for a construction to trigger 1, there should be no other marker in the clause that signals polar interrogation, not even lack of finiteness compared to the affirmative. This excludes intonation, which may be different between questions and declarative statements.	verb	mood, interrogation	conjugation	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB291	Can polar interrogation be marked by tone?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature deals with the presence or absence of a construction where the only difference between the interrogative and the declarative is marked by tone. Please note that tone is the focus here, not intonation. Tonal marking is bound to a certain position in the clause (e.g. the final syllable, or a certain constituent). Intonation concerns the whole clause and will have a variation in pitch across sentences and phrases.	verb, clause, sentence	mood, interrogation	tone	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB296	Is there a phonologically or morphosyntactically definable class of ideophones that includes ideophones depicting imagery beyond sound?	1: present, 0: absent						Ideophones are marked words that depict sensory imagery, e.g. *glimmer*, *twiddle*, *tinkle*. In some languages, ideophones may have different morphosyntactic characteristics from other word classes (e.g. they have different morphology, or they have no morphology at all while other classes do; or they may be extremely free when it comes to word order, in comparison to other words). They may also feature sounds that are not present anywhere else in the language. Every language probably has ideophones, but not every language has a very well defined class of ideophones.	ideophone	iconicity	declension, conjugation, word order	Jakob Lesage
GB297	Can polar interrogation be indicated by a V-not-V construction?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature concerns polar interrogative constructions where the main verb is repeated, once in the affirmative form and again in the negated form, as a pragmatically unmarked way of asking questions. The negated form can also occur before the affirmative form.	clause, verb, negator	TAM, mood, interrogation, negation	particle, conjugation, word order	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB298	Can standard negation be marked by an inflecting word (‘auxiliary verb’)?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature refers to Standard Negation, i.e. the constructions that mark negation of (at least) dynamic (not-stative) verbal predicates in declarative mood. This question aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) markers that inflect (i.e. change form depending on TAM, person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These inflecting phonologically free markers are often described as ‘auxiliary verbs’ in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels by some authors (such as STAMP morphemes (STAM = Subject-Tense-Aspect-Mood-Polarity) or inflecting pronouns). We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory marking](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness).	auxiliary, negator	TAM, negation	auxiliary	Hedvig Skirgård
GB299	Can standard negation be marked by a non-inflecting word (‘auxiliary particle’)?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature refers to Standard Negation, i.e. the constructions that mark negation of (at least) dynamic (not-stative) verbal predicates in declarative mood. This question aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) markers that do not inflect (i.e. change form depending on TAM, person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These markers are often described as particles in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking.  This particle does not have to be the sole marker of negation. There may be other markers in the language or the marker may be accompanied by other markers within the same construction. For example, the particle may be part of a double negation construction including both an affix and a particle.	particle, negator	TAM, negation	particle	Hedvig Skirgård
GB300	Does the verb for ‘give’ have suppletive verb forms?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns strong suppletion in verbs of giving. Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. So called ‘weak’ suppletion is not included. An example of this is English _went_ and _go_. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense.	verb, index	verb classification, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, negation, argument marking, core arguments, oblique	suppletion, conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB301	Is there an inclusory construction?	1: present, 0: absent						We are looking for a construction where a nonsingular referent is expressed by a nonsingular form (superset) and a singular form (subset). The element expressing the superset could be either [a free pronoun, an index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or a plural noun/proper noun. An example: in ***We Harald** talked* ‘Harald and I talked.’, the free 1PL pronoun *we* is a superset, and included within that is the subset which is the 1SG referent (the ‘I’ in the translation) and the proper noun *Harald*. In some languages, this construction may involve associative duals and plurals. This feature includes implicit inclusory constructions (as seen above) and explicit inclusory constructions which may have an overt inclusory marker in the construction to further mark the inclusory construction. The subset can be expressed with different word classes such as proper nouns, numerals, demonstratives, etc. Inclusory constructions often take the form of nominal coordination constructions.	NP, noun, pronoun	clusivity, deixis, person, number, coordination	declension, special construction	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB302	Is there a phonologically free passive marker (‘particle’ or ‘auxiliary’)?	1: present, 0: absent						Passivization is a valency reducing operation that takes a transitive clause (*The dog bites the man.*) and turns it into an intransitive clause by promoting the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the man*) to morphosyntactic [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) function. In the resulting intransitive clause, the former [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the dog*) either vanishes or adopts an oblique function: *The man is bitten (by the dog).* ‘Mediopassives’, ‘anticausatives’ and the sort (e.g. *x breaks the vase* > *the vase breaks*) also count as passives. This question targets [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) particles or auxiliaries marking passive clauses.	particle, auxiliary	passive, valency change, derivation, valency decrease	particle, auxiliary	Jakob Lesage
GB303	Is there a phonologically free antipassive marker (‘particle’ or ‘auxiliary’)?	1: present, 0: absent						An antipassive marker detransitivizes verbs by removing the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument or realizing it as an oblique. In a construction with ergative alignment, this means that the [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument of a transitive clause is encoded as the [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument in a corresponding antipassive clause. An antipassive marker often also has other detransitivizing functions, such as reflexivization, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative. In practice, this feature targets any intransitivizing marker that is not, or not only, a reflexive, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative marker. This question targets [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) particles or auxiliaries marking antipassive clauses.	particle, auxiliary	antipassive, valency change, derivation, valency decrease	particle, auxiliary	Jakob Lesage
GB304	Can the agent be expressed overtly in a passive clause?	1: present, 0: absent						Passivization is a detransitivizing operation that takes a transitive clause (*The dog bites the man.*) and turns it into an intransitive clause by promoting the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the man*) to morphosyntactic [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) function. In the resulting intransitive clause, the former [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the dog*) either vanishes or adopts an oblique function: *The man is bitten (by the dog).* ‘Mediopassives’, ‘anticausatives’ and the sort (e.g. *x breaks the vase* > *the vase breaks*) also count as passives. For languages with multiple passive constructions (e.g. ‘personal’ and ‘impersonal’ passives), this question should be answered 1 if the agent can be overtly expressed in any of these types of passive clauses. If the agent is overtly expressed, it may be unmarked or it may be marked in a number of ways: by case marking or adpositions, word order, etc.	clause	passive, valency change, derivation, valency decrease	absence vs. presence	Jakob Lesage
GB305	Is there a phonologically independent reflexive marker?	1: present, 0: absent						Reflexive markers indicate that a participant is coreferential with another participant in the clause or sentence (cf. Haspelmath & The APiCS Consortium 2013). A reflexive marker can be derived from pronouns with reflexive morphology (e.g. *him-self* in English, *lui-même* in French). If reflexive meaning is expressed with a body part noun, e.g. a noun meaning ‘body’ or ‘head’ (*They are scolding their body* to mean ‘They are scolding themselves’), this also counts as 1. Emphatic pronouns (e.g. *She cooked it (by) herself.*) do not trigger a 1, since they do not express a participant.	pronoun	valency change, reflexive	paradigm	Jakob Lesage
GB306	Is there a phonologically independent reciprocal marker that does not consist of two quantifiers (e.g. each + other; two + two)?	1: present, 0: absent						Reciprocal markers indicate that an action or feeling is mutual across two or more parties (e.g. *they love each other*; *they beat each other*). This feature targets [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) reciprocal markers that do *not* consist of two quantifiers. Such markers may be described as pronouns, particles or auxiliaries. They may be composite, as long as they do not consist of two quantifiers. A reciprocal marker may indicate both reflexive and reciprocal functions. It needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not limited to a small set of verbs that are probably lexicalized.	pronoun	valency change, reflexive, reciprocal	paradigm	Jakob Lesage
GB309	Are there multiple past or multiple future tenses, distinguishing distance from time of reference?	1: present, 0: absent						This question aims to capture productive marking of tense that makes distinctions into remoteness of time in relation to the point of reference or utterance. The actual marking can be tonal, verbal affixation, suppletion or any other means of marking.  This feature pertains to temporal marking, not aspectual. ‘Present perfect’ and ‘pluperfect’ are not included since they do not denote difference in distance of time but sequence of events.	verb, auxiliary, particle	TAM, tense	conjugation, special construction	Hedvig Skirgård
GB312	Is there overt morphological marking on the verb dedicated to mood?	1: present, 0: absent						This question is concerned with [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) marking on the verb that indicates grammatical mood. Grammatical mood is concerned with (1) the relationship between an event/state/action expressed in a clause and its actualization in reality (e.g. realis or irrealis) and/or (2) the speaker’s attitude towards the actualization of this event/state/action. This feature covers all grammatical moods, including declarative. The mood marker may be polysemous with other markers.  While negation or interrogation can be considered grammatical moods, they are not covered by this feature.	verb	TAM, mood, modality	conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB313	Are there special adnominal possessive pronouns that are not formed by an otherwise regular process?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature identifies phonologically independent possessive pronouns that are not formed by the application of regular possessive morphology or core case marking to more general pronominal forms. Instead, languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature form at least some possessive pronouns through some process other than the usual possessive marking, or, frequently, with suppletive forms. Note that special adnominal possessive pronouns are most commonly found in the first and second person.  To qualify as ‘special adnominal possessive pronouns’, the possessive pronouns must not be identical to the pronominal forms used for core arguments. It is not necessary for the possessive pronouns to be dedicated solely to the function of possession, provided that the criteria above are satisfied.	pronoun	attributive possession, attribution, genitive	declension, flagging, paradigm	Hannah J. Haynie
GB314	Can augmentative meaning be expressed productively by a shift of noun class/gender?	1: present, 0: absent						Can augmentative function be marked by a shift of [noun class?](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) This needs to be a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) pattern. Augmentative marking generally intensifies the noun (in size as well as various other properties). Here the augmentative construction must minimally be used to encode augmented size.	noun	gender, derivation, nominalization, augmentative	declension, derivational morphology	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB315	Can diminutive meaning be expressed productively by a shift of noun class/gender?	1: present, 0: absent						Can diminutive function (i.e. smaller size) be marked by a shift of [noun class?](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) We are looking for morphemes in the sentence which vary depending on the noun used, and whether one of these morphemes can be used to change the meaning of a noun by adding the meaning ‘small’. This needs to be a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) pattern. Diminutive function often also entails other meanings, but it needs to minimally encode smaller size.	noun	gender, derivation, nominalization, diminutive	declension, derivational morphology	Jay Latarche and Jeremy Collins
GB316	Is singular number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns regular marking of singular number in the noun phrase by a marker that is not bound to the noun, but free-standing. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB042 Is there a productive overt morphological singular marker on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB042), which focuses on the bound marking of singular number. (For more on wordhood and bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27).)  Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.	NP	number	particle	Hedvig Skirgård
GB317	Is dual number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?	1: present, 0: absent						"This feature intends to capture dual marking with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. Nouns derived from adjectives or verbs are not relevant. This feature contrasts with [GB043	Is there a productive morphological dual marker on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB043) which focuses on bound marking of dual number.  Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.  It can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices."	NP	number	particle	Hedvig Skirgård
GB318	Is plural number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns regular marking of plural number in the noun phrase by a marker that is not bound to the noun but free-standing. This marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB044 Is there a productive morphological plural marker on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB044) which focuses on bound marking of plural number. For more on wordhood and bound marking, please see this [page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27).  Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.

GB319	Is trial number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns regular marking of trial number in the noun phrase by a marker that is not bound to the noun, but [free-standing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). The marking should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB165 Is there a productive morphological trial marker on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB165) which focuses on the bound marking of trial number. For more on wordhood and bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27).  Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still be coded as 1, as long as the other functions do not interfere with the number distinction and as long as number marking is productive and regular.  It can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.	NP	number	particle	Hedvig Skirgård
GB320	Is paucal number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns regular marking of paucal number in the noun phrase by a marker that is not bound to the noun but [free-standing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). This marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB166 Is there a productive morphological paucal marker on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB166)) which focuses on bound marking of paucal number.

GB321	Is there a large class of nouns whose noun class/gender is not phonologically or semantically predictable?	1: present, 0: absent						A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature asks whether there is a large or open class of nouns whose gender/noun class assignment is not predictable based on phonology or semantics. In other words, such a class will appear to be assigned arbitrarily.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah J. Haynie
GB322	Is there grammatical marking of direct evidence (perceived with the senses)?	1: present, 0: absent						This question is concerned with the marking of evidentiality related to the speaker’s direct sensory evidence for some event or action. Grammatical marking of evidentials involves the use of grammaticalized markers such as affixes or other morphology, evidential particles, or evidential auxiliary verbs to convey the evidential meaning. Grammatical marking contrasts with constructions that express this meaning by means of adverbs (e.g. *John **apparently** ate the cake*) or lexical verbs in multi-clausal constructions (e.g. *I **saw** that John had eaten the cake*). Visual evidence is a common form of information encoded with a direct evidential, however direct evidentiality may also include auditory or other non-visual categories of sensory evidence. This question should be coded 1 if the language has a single direct evidential or any number of sensory evidentials.	verb, auxiliary, particle	TAM, evidentiality	conjugation, particle	Hannah J. Haynie
GB323	Is there grammatical marking of indirect evidence (hearsay, inference, etc.)?	1: present, 0: absent						This question is concerned with the marking of evidentiality related to the speaker's indirect, non-sensory evidence for some event or action. Grammatical marking of evidentials involves the use of grammaticalized markers such as affixes or other morphology, evidential particles, or evidential auxiliary verbs to convey the evidential meaning, in contrast to constructions that create this meaning through the use of adverbs (e.g. *John **reportedly** ate the cake*) or lexical verbs in multi-clause constructions (e.g. *They **say** that John ate the cake*). Indirect evidentiality usually involves inference from physical evidence or second-hand knowledge such as hearsay. This question should be coded 1 if there is a single category of indirect evidentiality or any number of inferential or reportative evidential categories that are marked grammatically.	verb, auxiliary, particle	TAM, evidentiality	conjugation, particle	Hannah J. Haynie
GB324	Is there an interrogative verb for content interrogatives (who?, what?, etc.)?	1: present, 0: absent						Interrogative verbs are verbs that include a semantic wh-element. In other words, the semantic content of interrogative verb roots includes an element equivalent to a content question, with meanings such as, ‘to do what’ or ‘to be who’. The wh-element must behave like a verb in the language. In English, for example, it would require regular verbal morphology, as in, *You what-ed yesterday?* (meaning, ‘what did you do yesterday?’). The feature does not include verbs of asking (e.g. English *ask*, *inquire*) or interrogative forms created through affixation of interrogative markers to non-interrogative verb roots.	verb, interrogative	mood, interrogation	conjugation, paradigm	Hannah J. Haynie
GB325	Is there a count/mass distinction in interrogative quantifiers?	1: present, 0: absent						When interrogatives are used to question quantity, are different interrogative forms used to quantify count nouns and mass nouns? For example, English contrasts *how many* for count nouns (as in, *how many apples?*) and *how much* for mass nouns (as in, *how much sand?*). Languages that have at least one form that means either ‘how much' (of a mass noun) or ‘how many' (of a count noun), but not the alternative, are considered to have a count/mass distinction in interrogative quantifiers. Languages in which any interrogative quantifiers can be used interchangeably with both count and mass nouns do not have the relevant distinction.	interrogative	mood, interrogation, quantification	paradigm, declension	Hannah J. Haynie
GB326	Do (nominal) content interrogatives normally or frequently occur in situ?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a commonly used content question construction in which the interrogative pronoun or NP (e.g. English *who* or *which one*) occurs in the normal position for a non-interrogative NP in the same participant role (i.e. ‘in situ’)? Many languages usually place the wh-constituent in situ (e.g. *The man took **what**?*; cf. *The man took **an umbrella**.*), while others require wh-constituents to occur in a specific position (e.g. clause-initially) regardless of the usual position of the corresponding non-interrogative NP (e.g. English ***What** did the man take?*). Here we are interested in identifying languages that frequently or generally use an interrogative construction with nominal wh-constituents in situ. This question should be coded 1 if questions formed with in situ interrogatives are pragmatically unmarked and are used commonly (e.g. not only in restrictive contexts such as echo questions or constructions with multiple interrogatives).	interrogative, clause	mood, interrogation	word order	Hannah J. Haynie
GB327	Can the relative clause follow the noun?	1: present, 0: absent						Can non-correlative relative clauses immediately follow the noun they modify? In other words, are there relative clauses with the structure *[The woman **[who has a green hat]** is tall*? This question only concerns relative clauses that immediately follow the noun, without requiring an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause – which would make them correlative relative clauses (e.g. *[The woman who has a green hat] she is tall*) (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)).	clause, NP	relativization	word order	Jakob Lesage
GB328	Can the relative clause precede the noun?	1: present, 0: absent						Can non-correlative relative clauses immediately precede the noun they modify? In other words, are there relative clauses with the structure *[**[Who has a green hat]** the woman] is tall*? This question only concerns relative clauses that immediately precede the noun, without requiring an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause - which would make them correlative relative clauses (e.g. *I saw her [who has a green hat the woman]*) (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)).	clause, NP	relativization	word order	Jakob Lesage
GB329	Are there internally-headed relative clauses?	1: present, 0: absent						Can a relativized noun be morphosyntactically part of the relative clause? This could mean different things in different languages. In some languages, the relativized noun may literally be inside the relative clause, in terms of placement, for example *[A green hat **[the woman]** has] is tall* to mean ‘The woman who has a green hat is tall’. In other languages, the noun may receive case marking for its function inside the relative clause rather than its function inside the main clause, for example *the man-SBJ greeted [**[the woman-SBJ]** who has a green hat]* as opposed to *the man-SBJ greeted [**[the woman-OBJ]** who has a green hat]*. Do not consider correlative relative clauses here (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)). It must be possible for the head noun to be any noun, not only an unspecific (pro)noun (e.g. *whoever*).	clause, NP	relativization	word order	Jakob Lesage
GB330	Are there correlative relative clauses?	1: present, 0: absent						Are there relative clauses that require an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause? For example, *[The woman who has a green hat] **she** is tall.*	clause, NP	relativization	word order	Jakob Lesage
GB331	Are there non-adjacent relative clauses?	1: present, 0: absent						Is there a non-correlative relative clause that is not adjacent to its modified noun? For example, in ***[The woman]** is tall **[who has a green hat]***, the noun (*woman*) is not adjacent to its modifying relative clause (*who has a green hat*). It must be possible for the head noun to be any noun, not only an unspecific (pro)noun (e.g. *whoever*). Do not consider correlative relative clauses for this feature (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)).	clause, NP	relativization	word order	Jakob Lesage
GB333	Is there a decimal numeral system?	1: present, 0: absent						Are some multiples of 10 starting from 30 formed with a decimal base? e.g. 30 = 3x10, 40 = 4x10, etc. Or are expressions between these decimals (30-40, 40-50 etc.) formed as 30+1, 30+2, .., 30+9 etc.? The coding should reflect the earliest attested (i.e. not merely inferred) stage so if a pre-borrowing stage is attested, this should be coded.	numeral	quantification	paradigm	Jakob Lesage
GB334	Is there synchronic evidence for any element of a quinary numeral system?	1: present, 0: absent						Are some numerals above 5 formed with 5 as a base? For example, 6 = 5+1, 7 = 5+2, 8 = 5+3, 9 = 5+4, 11 = 5+5+1, etc.? One example of this is enough for a 1, except if it can be derived from an already existing non-quinary system (e.g. if 10 = 5x2, but other numerals are also formed by doubling, e.g. 4 = 2x2 and 6 = 3x2, this does not count).	numeral	quantification	paradigm	Jakob Lesage
GB335	Is there synchronic evidence for any element of a vigesimal numeral system?	1: present, 0: absent						Are some numerals for multiples of 20 expressed using a base-20 system (e.g. 40 = 2x20; 60 = 3x20; 80 = 4x20; 120 = 6x20, etc.)? Or are numerals in between these multiples of 20 formed as 20+1, 20+2, .., 20+19; 40+1, 40+2, .., 40+19, etc.?	numeral	quantification	paradigm	Jakob Lesage
GB336	Is there a body-part tallying system?	1: present, 0: absent						Body-part tallying systems are counting systems that use body parts other than hands, feet, fingers or toes. Counting starts from one hand, tallying parts of the body along the arm, up to the head and then continuing with symmetric tally points down the other side of the body. Body-part tallying systems are usually only used in some social situations, such as traditional bride price negotiations. Some languages with decimal, quinary or vigesimal systems use words for *head* or *body* to represent *10* or *20*, the word for *hand* to mean *5* or the word for *eye* to mean *1*. These do not count as body-part tallying systems in the absence of a sequence of other body-part tally points.	numeral	quantification	paradigm	Jakob Lesage
GB400	Are all person categories neutralized in some voice, tense, aspect, mood and/or negation?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns languages which can [index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) the person of an [argument (S, A or P)](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) somewhere in the clause (i.e. either on the verb or by clitics). The question asks whether person categories are not distinguished under certain circumstances. In order for there to be neutralization, there needs to be something to ‘neutralize’ to begin with, i.e. languages without person indexing should be coded 0 for this feature. All person categories should be neutralized for the language to be coded as 1. Do not consider [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) pronouns for this question and ignore imperative clauses. Consider only independent clauses.	verb, pronoun, particle, auxiliary, index	person, valency change, TAM, passive, antipassive, tense, aspect, mood, modality, negation, argument marking, core arguments	conjugation, paradigm, indexing	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB401	Is there a class of patient-labile verbs?	1: present, 0: absent						The term ‘labileʼ is the most commonly used label for verbs which can be used transitively or intransitively without any formal change. A distinction is made between [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P))-lability (or patient-preserving lability, as in _I broke **the stick**_[P] / _**The stick** broke_) and [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P))-lability (or agent-preserving lability, as in _**John**_[A] _drinks tea / **John** drinks_). In case of P-lability, the P argument is preserved in the intransitive construction. This question asks only about P-labile verbs. Semantically, two things can happen with P-labile verbs. In case of (a) argument structure modifying P-lability, an otherwise transitive verb is used in the intransitive construction encoding an argument structure from which the A argument of the transitive construction is absent. In case of (b) less common argument structure preserving P-lability, the verb in its intransitive use implies the same participants with the same roles as in its transitive use, but in the intransitive use, the A argument is not expressed and is interpreted as non-specific.	verb	valency change, verb classification	none	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB402	Does the verb for ‘see’ have suppletive verb forms?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns strong suppletion in verb(s) of seeing/watching/looking. Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. ‘Weak’ suppletion is not included. An example of this is English _went_ and _go_. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense.  Please note that we are not interested in words that are translated as ‘look for’, ‘seek’ etc. This feature is concerned with the transitive verb of the act of seeing, not with metaphorical extensions such as 'seek up’.	verb	verb classification, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, negation, argument marking, core arguments, oblique	suppletion, conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB403	Does the verb for ‘come’ have suppletive verb forms?	1: present, 0: absent						This question concerns  strong suppletion in verbs of coming. Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. An example of this is English _went_ and _go_. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. ‘Weak’ suppletion is not included.	verb	verb classification, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, negation, argument marking, core arguments, oblique	suppletion, conjugation	Hedvig Skirgård
GB408	Is there any accusative alignment of flagging?	1: present, 0: absent						"Are [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments flagged differently from  [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments (i.e. do they show accusative alignment)? Flagging covers any kind of argument marking on the argument itself (e.g. by case or adposition marking). The marking can be phonologically free or bound. The marking of [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments is not relevant for establishing whether there is any accusative flagging or not, it is the difference between S and P flagging that results in 1. In case of split flagging systems (specifically, differential object marking), code as 1 if any of the subsystems (e.g. only nouns or only pronouns, or a particular group of nouns) shows accusative alignment. Note that although alignment types are occasionally associated with entire languages (e.g. when one says that ""Dyirbal is an ergative language""), they in fact apply only to individual constructions. This question asks only about the alignment of flagging, the alignment of [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or of any other construction is irrelevant for this question."	noun, NP, case marker, adposition	argument marking, core arguments	flagging, declension	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB409	Is there any ergative alignment of flagging?	1: present, 0: absent						"Are [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments flagged differently from  [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments (i.e. do they show ergative alignment)?

The marking of [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments is not relevant for establishing whether there is any ergative flagging or not, it is the difference between S and A flagging that results in 1. In case of split flagging systems (specifically, split ergativity), code as 1 if any of the subsystems (e.g. only nouns or only pronouns, or a particular tense or person) shows ergative alignment. Note that although alignment types are occasionally associated with entire languages (e.g. when one says that ""Dyirbal is an ergative language""), they in fact apply only to individual constructions. This question asks only about the alignment of flagging, the alignment of [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or of any other construction is irrelevant for this question."	noun, NP, case marker, adposition	argument marking, core arguments	flagging, declension	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB410	Is there any neutral alignment of flagging?	1: present, 0: absent						"Are [S, A, and P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments flagged identically (i.e. are they neutrally aligned)? Flagging covers any kind of argument marking on the argument itself (e.g. by case or adposition marking). The marking can be phonologically free or bound. In case of split flagging systems, reply with 1 if any of the subsystems (e.g. only nouns or only pronouns, or a particular tense or person) shows neutral alignment. Reply with 1 if none of the three arguments is overtly flagged (i.e. if all three arguments are zero-marked). Note that although alignment types are occasionally associated with entire languages (e.g. when one says that ""Dyirbal is an ergative language""), they in fact apply only to individual constructions. This question asks only about the alignment of flagging, the alignment of [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or of any other construction is irrelevant for this question."	noun, NP, case marker, adposition	argument marking, core arguments	flagging, declension	Alena Witzlack-Makarevich
GB415	Is there a politeness distinction in second person forms?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature asks whether there are different second person pronoun forms that are used based on the level of respect accorded by the speaker to the addressee. In some cases polite pronouns are used to indicate a level of formality or unfamiliarity between speaker and addressee. In other cases politeness distinctions are used according to very specific social relationships between speaker and addressee, such as relative age, social status, or kinship. If multiple second person pronoun forms exist in a single number category, and their use is patterned according to the level of intimacy or hierarchy of social relationship between speaker and addressee, this will suffice for a 1 code. The contrastive forms may or may not have other uses (e.g. in French the form *tu* is used only for second person singular informal, while *vous* is used for both second person singular polite and second person plural); a politeness distinction triggers a 1 for this feature regardless of whether the relevant forms have other functions/meanings.	pronoun, index, verb	politeness, person	paradigm, declension	Hannah J. Haynie
GB421	Is there a preposed complementizer for complements of verbs of thinking and/or knowing?	1: present, 0: absent						Complementizers are markers (free or bound) which are able to turn a clause into the subject or object of a sentence. In some of the literature these are also known as ‘conjunctions’. The complementizer in the sentence *I knew **that** Ashley was a genius* is _**that**_ and it is preposed to the complement clause (*Ashley was a genius*). The complementizer does not have to be [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence), the position in relation to the complement clause is what is relevant. This feature concerns whether the complementizer precedes the complement or not.  This feature specifically targets sentences with verbs of thinking and knowing, where the complement clause is an object (*I know that he is truthful* or *I think that this is a bad idea*). This is done so that we get more comparable data across the sample.	verb, index, complementizer, particle, clause	subordination	word order	Hedvig Skirgård
GB422	Is there a postposed complementizer for complements of verbs of thinking and/or knowing?	1: present, 0: absent						Complementizers are markers (free or bound) which are able to turn a clause into the subject or object of a sentence.

GB430	Can adnominal possession be marked by a prefix on the possessor?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where a possessor (either nominal or pronominal) is marked with a [prefix or proclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) to indicate possession of an object. This frequently takes the form of a genitive prefix on a possessor, but may also involve other types of prefixes or proclitics. Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that precedes and is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) to the possessor nominal/pronominal.	noun, NP, case marker, index	attributive possession, attribution, genitive	word order, flagging, prefixation	Hannah J. Haynie
GB431	Can adnominal possession be marked by a prefix on the possessed noun?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where possession is marked by a [prefix or proclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) on the possessed noun. In some cases, the morpheme that marks possession indexes agreement categories of the possessor. Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that precedes and is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) to the possessed noun.	noun, NP, case marker, index	attributive possession, attribution, genitive	word order, flagging, prefixation	Hannah J. Haynie
GB432	Can adnominal possession be marked by a suffix on the possessor?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where a possessor (either nominal or pronominal) is marked with a [suffix or enclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) to indicate possession of an object. This frequently takes the form of a genitive suffix on a possessor, but may also involve other types of suffixes or enclitics. Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that follows and is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) to the possessor noun/pronoun.	noun, NP, case marker, index	attributive possession, attribution, genitive	word order, flagging, suffixation	Hannah J. Haynie
GB433	Can adnominal possession be marked by a suffix on the possessed noun?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where possession is marked by a [suffix or enclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) on the possessed noun. In some cases, the possessive suffix indexes agreement categories of the possessor. Crucially, the possession must be marked by a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) element that follows and is phonologically bound to the possessed noun.	noun, NP, case marker, index	attributive possession, attribution, genitive	word order, flagging, suffixation	Hannah J. Haynie
GB519	Can mood be marked by a non-inflecting word (‘auxiliary particle')?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature covers all grammatical moods (the relationship between the referred event/state/action and reality and/or speakers' attitude toward what they are saying) and aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) elements that do not inflect (i.e. do not change form depending on person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These markers are often described as ‘[particles](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles)' in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking.  While negation or interrogation can be considered as grammatical moods, they are not included in this feature.	particle	TAM, mood, modality	particle	Hedvig Skirgård
GB520	Can aspect be marked by a non-inflecting word (‘auxiliary particle’)?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature covers all grammatical aspects (internal temporal constitution of event/action/state) and aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) elements that do not inflect (i.e. change form depending on person, number and other categories of the core arguments).  These markers are often described as ‘[particles](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles)’ in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels.

GB521	Can tense be marked by a non-inflecting word (‘auxiliary particle’)?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature covers all tenses (present, past and future) and aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) elements that do no inflect (i.e. do not change form depending on person, number and other categories of the core arguments).

This means that words such as ‘tomorrow’ and ‘yesterday’ do not qualify as productively marking future and hesternal past.	particle	TAM, tense	particle	Hedvig Skirgård
GB522	Can the S or A argument be omitted from a pragmatically unmarked clause when the referent is inferable from context (‘pro-drop’)?	1: present, 0: absent						This feature identifies languages that do not require a phonologically overt [S or A argument](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) expressed by a noun phrase or [phonologically independent pronoun](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) when the referent can be inferred from context. These languages are often called ‘pro-drop’ languages, and the phenomenon is generally referred to as ‘null anaphora’ or ‘zero anaphora’.  Here ‘omitted’ means phonologically unexpressed (we do not intend for this feature to make any distinctions regarding the theoretical status of a null argument). To count as 1, pro-drop should occur where the S or A argument might otherwise be expressed by an independent pronoun or full noun phrase. Specifically, pro-drop should occur in simple, declarative main clauses.  Pro-drop is not mutually exclusive with [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) of the S or A argument on the verb. If, in the absence of an independent pronoun or nominal S or A, there is indexing of this argument on the verb, you may still code 1.	pronoun, NP, clause	predication	presence vs. absence	Hannah J.
