GB020	Are there definite or specific articles?	1: present, 0: absent					"An article is a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity and (in)definiteness. Sometimes these notions of specificity and definiteness are summed up in the term ""identifiability"".  A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not to be similar in formal expression or position.  The formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone. Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm where there are markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often obligatory in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning 'a certain'. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives, and also with classifiers."	article, NP, demonstrative	definiteness, deixis	declension, particle, paradigm	Jay & Jeremy
GB021	Do indefinite nominals commonly have indefinite articles?	1: present, 0: absent					In this question, we need explicit support that indefinite NPs do/do not commonly occur with an indefinite/non-specific article. Indefinite articles can be homophonous with demonstratives, the numeral 'one' or classifiers.	article, NP, demonstrative	definiteness, deixis	declension, particle, paradigm	Jay and Jeremy
GB022	Are there prenominal articles?	1: present, 0: absent					All questions concerning the order of elements aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order.  'Articles' refers to definite or indefinite articles as defined in GB020 and GB021 respectively. In order to answer 1 for this feature, the marker's functions need to meet one of those definitions, and so 1 should also have been answered for GB020 or GB021.	article, NP, demonstrative	definiteness, deixis	word order, declension, particle, paradigm, prefixation	Jay and Jeremy
GB023	Are there postnominal articles?	1: present, 0: absent					All questions concerning the order of elements aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order. 'Articles' refers to definite or indefinite articles as defined in GB020 and GB021 respectively. In order to answer 1 for this feature, the marker's functions need to meet one of those definitions, and so 1 should also have been answered for GB020 or GB021.	article, NP, demonstrative	definiteness, deixis	word order, declension, particle, paradigm, suffixation	Jay and Jeremy
GB024	What is the order of numeral and noun in the NP?	multistate 1: Num-N; 2: N-Num; 3: both.					Consider cardinal numerals only (i.e., not ordinal numerals). It does not matter what kind of construction is required (e.g., attributive 'two books' or relative 'books that are two') or what word class the root or modifying form of that the cardinal numerals belong to, i.e., 'two-ing books' (verb) or 'two-some books' (noun) apply to this question. If some numerals go before the noun and some go after, code 3 (both orders). If there is a free choice where to place the numeral, code 3 (both orders) as well. If the order depends on some other grammatical category which is neutral with respect to pragmaticality (e.g. definiteness), code 3. If the order depends on the noun consider the order(s) that applies to an open class of nouns.	numeral, NP	quantification, attribution	word order	Hannah
GB025	What is the order of adnominal demonstrative and noun?	multistate 1: Dem-N; 2: N-Dem; 3: both.					This feature is concerned with the order of the noun and the adnominal (classes of words which modify the noun) demonstrative. There are three possible values to code, before the noun, after the noun, or that both orders are possible. Like all questions concerning the order of elements, only the pragmatically unmarked orders are targeted.	demonstrative, NP	deixis, attribution	word order	Jay and Jeremy
GB026	Can adnominal property words occur discontinuously?	1: present, 0: absent					"This means that a restrictively interpreted adjective is separated from the noun by some element that is not part of the nominal. For example, can you say ""The man is running big"" and the like to mean ""The big man is running"". Typically a language which allows this has extensive agreement systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent (i.e. the ""Australian type""). NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here. This features aims to capture NPs where the head and modifiers can be separated. Examples of the type ""I painted the house red"" or ""I saw the boy big"" are not necessarily discontinuous, but most likely resultative or contrastive (""I saw the boy big [as opposed to before when he was small]"")."	adjective, clause, NP	attribution	word order, special construction	Hannah
GB027	Are nominal conjunction and comitative expressed by different elements?	1: present, 0: absent					Is there a difference between the marking of NP coordination ('John and Mary went to market') and the marking of comitative phrases ('John with Mary went to market')? This is not always explicitly stated by the descriptive work, but an investigation into the examples and perhaps even appendixed text of the grammar should reveal this (to a certain extent). In some languages the only way to do nominal coordination is with a comitative phrase, i.e., the only way to say X and Y is to say X with Y. This feature aims to capture such languages (which, as they have no difference between coordination and comitatives for nouns, get a 0). To see whether an element is comitative or coordinating check for case marking, agreement etc. For example, if X is the element in question and in the dative you get 'John-DAT X Mary-DAT' then X is likely coordinating, while if you get John-DAT X Mary then X is likely comitative. Or with agreement, if you get 'John X Mary verb-PL' rather than 'John X Mary verb-SG' (just like 'John X suitcase verb-SG') then that suggests X is likely coordinating.	adposition, case marker, NP	argument marking, oblique, conjunction, coordination, case marking, comitative	declension, flagging	Hedvig
GB028	Is there a distinction between inclusive and exclusive?	1: present, 0: absent					Is there a pronoun or other marker that explicitly marks the inclusion of an interlocutor? This feature is not restricted to the pronominal system but includes person indexing as well. If inclusive is marked overtly in either the pronominal system or through verbal marking this is sufficient to trigger a (1) for this feature, even if exclusive has no overt morphological marking.	pronoun, index, verb	clusivity, deixis, person, number	declension, paradigm, indexing	Hannah
GB030	Is there a gender distinction in independent 3rd person pronouns?	1: present, 0: absent					This question targets the existence of a gender distinction in independent 3rd person anaphoric forms, which includes pronouns and also demonstratives. This distinction is often one of natural gender (masc./fem), but it could be animacy as well (see Corbett 1991 for further discussion of gender). For languages with no 3rd person independent pronouns a gender distinction in demonstratives would trigger a (1) here. If pronouns with inanimate referents agree with the gender/noun class of that inanimate noun that will also suffice for (1) here. If a language has a gender distinction for 3rd person pronouns but not for demonstratives, this is also sufficient for a (1) in this category.	pronoun	person, number, gender	declension, paradigm	Hannah
GB031	Is there a dual or unit augmented form (in addition to plural or augmented) for all person categories in the pronoun system?	1: present, 0: absent					A dual or unit augmented form must be present throughout the paradigm (i.e. for all person categories) for this feature to be coded as 1. Both bound and free person forms are to be considered in coding this feature. Inclusive and exclusive categories of 1st person are not considered separate person categories for the purposes of coding this feature (e.g. if a language has dual number in 3rd, 2nd, and any 1st person category it is sufficient for triggering a 1). A dual or unit augmented form for a single person category in the paradigm is *not* sufficient for a 1 code.	pronoun	person, number	declension, paradigm	Hannah
GB035	Are there three or more distance contrasts in demonstratives?	1: present, 0: absent					Demonstratives are modifiers that can modify nouns (of any type and not just a restricted set such as location nouns) to mark position (e.g. deixis or reference within discourse). This doesn't have to be only Euclidean distance (meters, inches etc.), it could also be concerned with near or far in relation to the interlocutors (cf. Wolof). If the system of demonstratives includes a marker that is anaphoric this does not count as a third distance.	demonstrative	deixis	declension, paradigm	Jay and Jeremy
GB036	Do demonstratives show an elevation distinction?	1: present, 0: absent					Elevation is concerned with how high up or low an object is (altitude).	demonstrative	deixis	declension, paradigm	Jay and Jeremy
GB037	Do demonstratives show a visible-nonvisible distinction?	1: present, 0: absent					Is there a distinction visible-non-visible when referencing to items that are in the same relative distance, i.e. it is not relevant that demonstratives denoting far away reference often also imply non-visibility.	demonstrative	deixis	declension, paradigm	Jay and Jeremy
GB038	Are there demonstrative classifiers?	1: present, 0: absent					This question concerns whether there exists a classifier system in which classifiers appear with demonstratives to classify the noun. This classifier system can be symmetrical with numeral, possessive or verbal classifiers. It is sufficient if they sometimes occur. Please note, this feature does not concern gender/noun classes and agreement with the noun class, but a separate nominal classifier system.	demonstrative, classifier, NP	deixis, nominal classification, attribution	declension, paradigm, special construction, particle	Jay and Jeremy
GB039	Is there nonphonological allomorphy of noun number markers?	1: present, 0: absent					Are there different number markers for a single number category? And is the choice between these markers unpredictable from the marker a noun receives in another number category? For example, are there different plural markers while there is only one (or no) singular marker? Or do two nouns receive different singular markers but the same plural marker? This feature targets bound number markers, free number markers, and clitics.	noun, NP	number	declension	Jay and Jeremy
GB041	Are there several nouns (more than three) which are suppletive for number?	1: present, 0: absent					"Suppletion is when a word is changed in such a way that the new word does not resemble the previous, for example English _went_ and _go_. If you are unsure if a form is ""enough different"" to count as suppletion, bring it up for discussion in the group. Only so called ""strong suppletion"" counts here.  Only answer (1) if there are more than three examples of this. Body-parts and kinship terms are good place to start investigating."	noun	number	suppletion, declension	Hedvig
GB042	Is there productive overt morphological singular marking on nouns?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns bound grammatical marking of singular number on nouns. The marker should be on an open set of nouns, not a restricted set. Absence of plural marking does not count for a 1 here (hence the emphasis on ""overt"" in the feature question). This feature is in contrast to [GB316 Is singular number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a dedicated phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB316) which focuses on the non-bound marking of singular number. For more on bound marking, please see this [page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'on-the-verb-noun'-or-'by-morphology'). If there is only bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs), that does not suffice for a 1.  Number marking is often fused with other functions, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as they don't interfere with the distinctions in numbers and as long as number marking is productive and regular."	noun	number, gender	declension	Hedvig
GB043	Is there productive morphological dual marking on nouns?	1: present, 0: absent					This question concerns bound grammatical marking of dual number on nouns. The marker should be on an open set of nouns, not a restricted set. This feature is in contrast to [GB317 Is dual number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a dedicated phonologically free element? ](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB317) which focuses on the non-bound marking of dual number. For more on bound marking, please see this [page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'on-the-verb-noun'-or-'by-morphology'). If there is only bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs), that does not suffice for a 1.  Number marking is often fused with other functions, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as they don't interfere with the distinctions in numbers and as long as number marking is productive and regular.	noun	number	declension	Hedvig
GB044	Is there productive morphological plural marking on nouns?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns bound grammatical marking of plural number on nouns. The marker should be on an open set of nouns, not a restricted set. This feature is in contrast to [GB318	Is plural number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a dedicated phonologically free element? ](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB318) which focusses on the non-bound marking of plural number.  For more on bound marking, please see this [page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'on-the-verb-noun'-or-'by-morphology'). If there is only bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs), that does not suffice for a 1. Furthermore, for this feature reduplication only isn't enough.  Number marking is often fused with other functions, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as they don't interfere with the distinctions in numbers and as long as number marking is productive and regular."	noun	number, gender	declension	Hedvig
GB046	Is there an associative plural marker for nouns?	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature aims to cover markers or markings that instead of signalling additive plural - ""several instances of X"" marks that the reference contains entities associated with X - ""X and other people/things associated with X’. For example, ""the King-s went to the market"" means there were several of the type ""king"" that went. An associative plural interpretation of ""s"" would be ""the King and his entourage went to the market"". This marker does not need to be bound to the noun. If the additive plural also has this function, this also counts."	noun	number	declension	Hedvig
GB047	Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an action/state noun from a verb?	1: present, 0: absent					"An action nominalization is a new construction that is derived from a verb and that functions like a noun, and denotes an action or state. In English, we can exemplify this with ""the enemy’s **destruction** of the city"" Arrive -arriving would also serves as an example, or 'La concentracio´n de Sherlock Holmes duro´ cinco horas' in Spanish (‘Sherlock Holmes’ concentration lasted five hours’). There needs to be productive derivation, but they can also refer to states or events - not just actions. Compounds of the verb root and a noun meaning ""action/state/event"" is likely not an action nominalization, bring it up for discussion if this is the only available construction that is mentioned in the descriptive material."	noun, verb	derivation, nominalization, gender	derivational morphology	Hedvig
GB048	Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an agent noun from a verb?	1: present, 0: absent					"An agent nominalization is a new construction that is derived from a verb and that functions like a noun, and denotes an agent of an action. In English, we can exemplify this with the productive _-er_ suffix (_baker, fisher, gardener_ etc.). There needs to be productive derivation. Compounds of the verb root and a noun meaning ""person"" is likely not an action nominalization, bring it up for discussion if this is the only available construction that is mentioned in the descriptive material."	noun, verb	derivation, nominalization, gender	derivational morphology	Hedvig
GB049	Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an object noun from a verb?	1: present, 0: absent					"An object nominalization is a new construction that is derived from a verb and that functions like a noun, and denotes the object/result of an action. There needs to be productive derivation. Compounds of the verb root and a noun meaning ""thing"" is likely not an action nominalization, bring it up for discussion if this is the only available construction that is mentioned in the descriptive material."	noun, verb	derivation, nominalization, gender	derivational morphology	Hedvig
GB051	Is there a gender/noun class system where sex is a factor in class assignment?	1: present, 0: absent					A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical agreement with other constituents in the nominal domain or with verbs, complementizers, or adpositions. Gender/noun class assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether biological sex is one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of their biological sex for this feature to be coded 1. That is, sex must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah
GB052	Is there a gender/noun class system where shape is a factor in class assignment?	1: present, 0: absent					A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical agreement with other constituents in the nominal domain or with verbs, complementizers, or adpositions. Gender/noun class assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the shape of an object is one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of their shape for this feature to be coded 1. That is, shape must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah
GB053	Is there a gender/noun class system where animacy is a factor in class assignment?	1: present, 0: absent					A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical agreement with other constituents in the nominal domain or with verbs, complementizers, or adpositions. Gender/noun class assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the animacy of a noun is one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of their animacy for this feature to be coded 1. That is, animacy must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. Note that while (biological) sex is generally associated with animate referents, a gender system that makes a distinction between male and female is not necessarily sufficient to trigger a 1 here. A gender system in which animacy is a relevant factor will often make a distinction between human or animal referents and non-living referents, and animate status may be extended to culturally important non-living entities (e.g. mythological figures) or objects (e.g. celestial bodies). A human/non-human distinction is sufficient for a 1 code.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah
GB054	Is there a gender/noun class system where plant status is a factor in class assignment?	1: present, 0: absent					A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical agreement with other constituents in the nominal domain or with verbs, complementizers, or adpositions. Gender/noun class assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether belonging to the kingdom of plants is one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for nouns that refer to plants to be classified in certain gender categories for this feature to be coded 1. That is, plant status must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah
GB057	Are there numeral classifiers?	1: present, 0: absent					This question concerns whether numerals take an element that varies depending on the noun used, and is not the same as a gender system used in the language (i.e. is not numeral agreement with gender).	numeral, classifier, NP	nominal classification, quantification, attribution	declension, paradigm, special construction, particle	Jay and Jeremy
GB058	Are there possessive classifiers?	1: present, 0: absent					This question concerns whether there exists an independent classifier system in possessive constructions that is not related to the other classifier systems such as the gender/noun class of the language or numeral classifiers.  We are concerned with markers that signal the nature of the possessor or the possessum (possessor classifiers/possessed classifiers). This feature applies to both pronominal/nominal possessors and markers which are bound or free. Possessive classifiers need not be obligatory, it can also be possible to construct possessive phrases without possessive classifiers.  Differences in the expression of individual, joint, separate and group possession are not relevant here.	noun, classifier, NP	attributive possession, attribution, nominal classification	declension, paradigm, special construction, particle	Jay and Jeremy
GB059	Is the adnominal possessive construction different for alienable and inalienable nouns?	1: present, 0: absent					Is there a morpho-syntactic difference in attributive possession that can be ascribed to alienability?  This feature applies to constructions with both pronominal and nominal possessors.  Typically, inalienable possession applies to the semantic domains of body parts and kinship, but it is sometimes found in other categories that don't align perfectly with the canonical notion of 'alienability', such as part-whole relationships other than body parts, social relationships other than kinship, or things inherently linked to a person (e.g. a person's voice, mental states, or other attributes).  This feature targets splits in possessive marking strategy where different classes of possessum are associated with different constructions, and where one of those possessum classes includes body parts and/or kinship terms, and possibly other categories that have strong semantic associations with their owners, social relationships, or part-whole relationships.	noun, NP	attributive possession, attribution, alienability	declension, special construction, particle	Hannah
GB065	What is the pragmatically unmarked order of adnominal possessor noun and possessed noun?	multistate 1:Possessor-Possessed; 2:Possessed-Possessor; 3: both					This feature focuses on the relative order of possessor and possessum (i.e. that which is possessed) in an adnominal possession construction. Coding should take into consideration only those possession constructions that are pragmatically unmarked (i.e. not focus). This feature applies to both nominal possessors and independent pronominal possessors. Affixal marking of possession, by contrast, is coded in features GB430-GB433.	noun, NP, index	attributive possession, attribution	word order	Hannah
GB068	Do core adjectives (defined semantically as property concepts such as value, shape, age, dimension) act like verbs in predicative position?	1: present, 0: absent					"Do core adjectives used as predicates take on verbal morphology? The predicative adjectives need not take exactly all verbal marking. If there is at least some marking that verbal and adjectival predicates share, this counts as 1 (for example, if a language has ""he runs"" and ""he greens""). This should apply to most verbs in the language. If there is additional morphology or there are additional elements that the adjective requires, then this feature should be coded as 0."	adjective, verb, index	predication, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, nominal classification, gender	declension, conjugation, indexing	Jay and Jeremy
GB069	Do core adjectives (defined semantically as property concepts; value, shape, age, dimension) used attributively require the same morphological treatment as verbs?	1: present, 0: absent					Do elements expressing attributive adjectival meaning receive the same treatment as verbs when verbs are used attributively, i.e. inside an NP? The adjectival roots need not take exactly all verbal marking. If there is at least some marking that verbal and adjectival roots share then there is a yes here. The result need not be finite, participles would count if that is the way verbs are marked when used attributively. This means that if the language in question forms modifying verbs by participles (“running man”) and this is the same for adjectival roots (“redding man”) then there is a yes here.	adjective, verb, index	attribution, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, nominal classification, gender	declension, conjugation, indexing	Jay and Jeremy
GB070	Are there morphological cases for non-pronominal core arguments (i.e. S/A/P)?	1: present, 0: absent					Morphological case involves any type of case marking (or flagging) that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, ...). Core arguments are those having S, A or P function. S is the single argument of an intransitive verb. P is the patient-like argument of a transitive verb. A is the agent-like argument of a transitive verb. If a bound marker distinguishes S from non-S NPs, this counts as a 1. Optional marking and marking with portmanteau morphemes (e.g. a marker both indicates that a noun phrase is plural and that it has P function) also count.	noun, NP, case marker	argument marking, core arguments	declension, flagging	Jakob
GB071	Are there morphological cases for independent personal pronominal core arguments (i.e. S/A/P)?	1: present, 0: absent					This question is about independent pronouns only; indexes are irrelevant here. Morphological case involves any type of case marking (or flagging) that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, ...). Core arguments are those having S, A or P function. S is the single argument of an intransitive verb. P is the patient-like argument of a transitive verb. A is the agent-like argument of a transitive verb. If a bound marker distinguishes S from non-S pronouns, this counts as a 1. Optional marking and marking with portmanteau morphemes (e.g. a marker both indicates that a noun phrase is plural and that it has P function) also count.	pronoun, case marker	argument marking, core arguments	declension, flagging	Jakob
GB072	Are there morphological cases for oblique non-pronominal NPs (i.e. not S/A/P)?	1: present, 0: absent					Morphological case involves any type of case marking (or flagging) that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, etc.). Oblique NPs are NPs having a function other than S, A or P, e.g. dative, locative, ablative instrumental, comitative, location in time, etc. Note that genitive or possessive are not seen as cases in Grambank.	noun, NP, case marker	argument marking, oblique	declension, flagging	Jakob
GB073	Are there morphological cases for independent oblique personal pronominal arguments (i.e. not S/A/P)?	1: present, 0: absent					Are independent personal pronouns morphologically marked for oblique case (i.e. not S/A/P)? Morphological case involves any type of case marking (or flagging) that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, etc.). Suppletion also counts as case marking for this feature. Oblique NPs are NPs having a function other than S, A or P, e.g. dative, locative, ablative instrumental, comitative, location in time, etc. Note that genitive or possessive are not seen as cases in Grambank.	pronoun, case marker	argument marking, oblique	declension, flagging	Jakob
GB074	Are there prepositions?	1: present, 0: absent					Prepositions mark core or oblique noun phrases. They precede the noun phrase they occur with. Proclitics (case markers that only occur noun phrase initially) count as prepositions in Grambank. This means that [phonological boundness](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) is not relevant to this question. Inpositions (which occur somewhere in between words in a noun phrase) do not count as prepositions. If there is only one preposition, this is enough for a 1 here.	noun, NP, case marker, adposition	argument marking, core arguments, oblique	word order, flagging	Jakob
GB075	Are there postpositions?	1: present, 0: absent					Postpositions mark core or oblique noun phrases. They follow the noun phrase they occur with. Enclitics (markers that only occur noun phrase finally) count as postpositions in Grambank. This means that [phonological boundness](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) is not relevant to this question. Inpositions (which occur somewhere in between words in a noun phrase) do not count as postpositions. If there is only one postposition, this is enough for a 1 here.	noun, NP, case marker, adposition	argument marking, core arguments, oblique	word order, flagging	Jakob
GB079	Do verbs have prefixes/proclitics, other than those that only mark A, S or P (do include portmanteau: A & S + TAM)?	1: present, 0: absent					These [prefixes or proclitics](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-clitics) could have a variety of functions, marking TAME, functioning as verbal derivation markers, as inverse markers, relative markers, etc. Only indexes dedicated to a single person do not count. The end result has to be a finite verb and cannot, for example, be a deverbal noun or an adverb.	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, oblique, TAM, negation, tense, aspect, mood, modality, valency change	conjugation, prefixation	Jakob
GB080	Do verbs have suffixes/enclitics, other than those that only mark A, S or P (do include portmanteau: A & S + TAM)?	1: present, 0: absent					These [suffixes or enclitics](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-clitics) could have a variety of functions, marking TAME, functioning as verbal derivation markers, as inverse markers, relative markers, etc. Only indexes dedicated to a single person do not count.

GB081	Is there productive infixation in verbs?	1: present, 0: absent					This affix must be stem-internal and dedicated to a particular purpose, either derivational or inflectional (see general definitions for more information on productivity and dedicated functions). In keeping with existing data, if the only infixation process described for a language involves reduplication, please code 0 but be sure to note in the comments field that infixing reduplication is present.	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, oblique, TAM, negation, tense, aspect, mood, modality, valency change	conjugation, infixation	Hannah
GB082	Is there overt morphological marking of present tense on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question aims at capturing overt productive paradigms of tense. ""On the verb"" here means that the marker has to form a phonological unit with the verb. The marking of tense can be: affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims at capturing over marking of present tense on the verb, i.e. lack of other markings is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary, for example some grammarians state that future tense is accomplished by a certain aspect on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is the productive grammatical obligatory way of expression the tense in question then such a construction is allowed to trigger yes (1) for both ""on the verb ""and ""auxiliary"". However, in the case of discontinuous marking, please contact the patron to go over details.  Sometimes a language will be described as having a past/non-past distinction. In this case, if there is an overt marker of non-past code the language as (1) for GB082, but (0) for [GB084 (future tense)](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB084). Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas ""present tense"" has less stricter demands on the scope of its function."	verb	TAM, tense	conjugation	Hedvig

GB084	Is there overt morphological marking on the verb dedicated to future tense?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question aims at capturing overt productive paradigms of tense.

Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas ""present tense"" has less stricter demands on the scope of its function.  It can be hard to distinguish future tense from different modal categories, after all if something is in the future it has not yet occurred and can be construed as something wished for, planned, intended etc rather than actually on the concrete timeline of events. This is why it's necessary to take extra notice on sections on mood, especially irrealis, when coding for future tense.  If a language only has future tense under negation, this does not count for this feature. It needs to be present for affirmation as well. [This was brought up in this issue thread.](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/issues/62) The reason for this is that conditions such as ""only under negation"" are likely to give rise to quite different analysis by different linguists (hence hard to ensure comparability) and might also be overlooked. If we were to treat such marginal cases as ""1"" we would most likely have to go back to a lot of the cases that were coded as ""0"" and re-evaluate their coding more thoroughly."	verb	TAM, tense	conjugation	Hedvig
GB086	Is a morphological distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect available on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature is concerned with bound marking of imperfective/perfective grammatical aspects. These categories could go by the name of punctual/continuous, preterit/progressive etc. The answer could be ""yes"" even if it's only one that is overtly marked, i.e. if imperfective is by affix and perfective by auxiliary for example. Please take notice that GB310 and GB86 are not covering exactly the same functions, they cover more grammatical aspects than punctual/continuous. If this marking is only relevant for a small subset of verbs, alert patron and discuss.  If this distinction is only available in some TAM-conditions, this counts as well. For example, if there isn't an aspectual distinction in the past but only in the present, this still triggers a '1'."	verb	TAM, aspect	conjugation	Hedvig

""1"" includes both the ""double-object construction"" and the ""secondary-object construction"" of Haspelmath (2013).  Consider as ditransitive only verbs expressing physical transfer of possession or mental transfer of message (give, lend, hand, feed, send, bring, show, tell, teach).  Consider as ditransitive verbs which allow overt expression of an agent, a theme and a recipient/addressee arguments as separate NPs.

This could be a causative affix or clitic, an applicative (benefactive, instrumental, ...), ... It has to be productive.

GB114	Is there a phonologically bound reflexive marker on the verb?	1: present, 0: absent					Reflexive markers indicate that a participant is coreferential with another participant in the clause or sentence (cf. Haspelmath & The APiCS Consortium 2013). This marker may indicate both reflexive and reciprocal functions. Reduplication of verbs also counts. It needs to be productive, not limited to a small set of verbs in the language.	verb, index	reflexive, valency change, derivation, valency decrease	derivational morphology, indexing	Jakob

The system can however be identical or very similar to the possessive, numeral or demonstrative classifier systems.	verb, index	nominal classification	incorporation, compounding, suppletion, affixation, conjugation	Jay and Jeremy
GB117	Is there a copula for predicate nominals?	1: present, 0: absent					Is there a copula in use (in an equative sentence) when the predicate is nominal? This copula does not have to be obligatory, nor a finite verb, it could be a demonstrative. Please note that adjectives are not included within the category of 'nominals' here.	verb, copula, clause, noun, auxiliary	predication, verb classification	particle, auxiliary, absence vs. presence	Jay and Jeremy
GB118	Are there serial verb constructions?	1: present, 0: absent					Serial verbs are two or more verbs in juxtaposition, functioning as a single predicate. Some languages allow intervening material and others do not. There is no morphology to mark their relationship with each other. Each of the verbs is a separate phonological word but the construction as a whole is expressed in one intonational unit. Morphology is shared to a greater or lesser extent.  Serial verbs are different from clause-chaining because the verbs involved in clause-chaining lack finiteness and cannot occur independently in that form whereas serial verbs take the appropriate finiteness marking. Serial verbs are different from compounds because they can each take their own arguments whereas the roots of a compound share arguments.	verb	predication	special construction	Jay and Jeremy
GB119	"Can mood be marked by an inflecting word (""auxiliary verb"")?"	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature covers all grammatical moods (the relationship between the referred event/state/action and other possible worlds, or speaker's attitude) and aims to capture phonologically free-standing elements that inflect (i.e. change form depending on arguments, environment or such). These markers are often described as ""auxiliary verbs"" in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are after grammatical marking, i.e. dedicated, productive and obligatory marking. Pay special attention to markers described as ""pronouns"" that take TAM-marking, they fulfilled our criteria of ""inflecting word"".  While negation or interrogation can be considered as grammatical moods, they are not included in this feature.  A crucial aspect of this feature is that the main verb should behave as it does when it is combined with other auxiliary verbs, which is often that it loses finite marking (""infinite"" mood). If there are other auxiliaries in the language that modifies main verbs, consider what changes occur there. Of course, if the language is isolating and there isn't much of verbal morphology this is less relevant or possible irrelevant all together."	auxiliary	TAM, mood, modality	auxiliary	Hedvig

GB122	Is verb compounding a regular process?	1: present, 0: absent					Verbal compounding is two or more verb stems acting as one phonological and grammatical word. Verb compounds share the same arguments. Languages with serial verbs can often have verb compounds too, however they might not always be described as such.  Serial verbs are different from clause-chaining because the verbs involved in clause-chaining lack finiteness and cannot occur independently in that form whereas serial verbs take the appropriate finiteness marking. Serial verbs are different from compounds because they can each take their own arguments whereas the roots of a compound share arguments.	verb	predication, derivation	compounding	Jay and Jeremy
GB123	Are there verb-adjunct (aka light-verb) constructions?	1: present, 0: absent					"[new summary from Jakob:] https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/issues/730  A light-verb construction is a complex predicate with two components: (1) a lexical stem which is not a verb and (2) an inflectable verb, which is called the light verb. The light verb makes no lexical semantic or functional semantic contribution to the complex predicate. It only serves as a placeholder for verbal inflection. It only makes the lexical stem function as a verb. Light verbs are the analytical counterparts of (denominal) verbalizers. They make a 'non-verb' function as a 'verb', and that is the only thing they do. Items that can occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions are: (1) nouns (e.g. 'do baby' in Ivorian English or 'have sex' in English for 'to copulate'), (2) adjectives (e.g. 'make beatiful' in English), (3) non-inflectable items such as ideophones (e.g. 'do ssss' for 'to make an ssss sound'), or (4) verbs borrowed from other languages that do not inflect in the target language. Regular verbs cannot occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions. This is the main difference between light-verb constructions and serial verb constructions. Serial verb constructions may contain verbs that lexico-semantically contribute to the meaning of the clause. Light-verb constructions may not. Light verbs are different from auxiliaries in that auxiliaries add a functional specification to the clause (e.g. tense, aspect, modality, negation), while light verbs don't add any such functional-semantic values to the clause.   This question concerns constructions involving a non-predicating element expressing the lexical meaning of the construction, in conjunction with a semantically fairly empty verb, which enables the element to function as a predicate by providing the necessary morphology, e.g. 'eye do' for 'see'; or 'sneeze hit' for 'sneeze'. Exclude constructions that fall into the categories of verb compounding, clause-chaining, auxiliaries and serial verbs are excluded from the category of ""light-verb"". The verb needs to be sufficiently productive, it cannot only concern a few instances. It is uninteresting whether the predicating element is of nominal/verbal/other root. This means for example that what is described in the literature as ""co-verb constructions"" most likely are a subcategory of light verbs. It is also uninteresting for the definition of light-verbs whether or not the non-finite predicating element can occur outside the construction or not, both scenarios are acceptable. The category of light verbs cannot all consist of constructions describing states, there has to be at least a few dynamic events. There should also be instances where it is hard to define whether the non-finite predicating element (adjunct) is clearly nominal or not."	verb, noun	predication, derivation	special construction	Jay and Jeremy
GB124	Is incorporation of nouns into verbs a productive intransitivizing process?	1: present, 0: absent					"Noun-verb incorporation is defined as a special construction where obligatorily bare (i.e. articleless, numberless, modifierless) nouns must occur adjacent to or inside of the verb (in a fixed order). This question asks essentially, can transitive verbs become intransitive by means of noun incorporation, and is this process productive? This need not be the default productive way of intransitivizing nouns, but the process must be productive. The incorporated noun is semantically the direct object of the verb. For example: ""he was painting the bike"" = ""he was bike-painting"". Noun incorporation where the noun is acting as modifier do not count, such as ""she was running like Jacob runs"" = ""she was Jacob-running"". If it is necessary to still overtly mark the direct object, for example with a pronoun, that does not count."	verb, noun	valency change, valency decrease, derivation	incorporation, compounding	Hannah
GB126	Is there an existential verb?	1: present, 0: absent					"Is there an element expressing existential predication (""God **exists**/There **is** a God""), that is **different from the equative or attributive copula**? It is possible that there are more than one existential verbs making further distinctions, temporary versus permanent existence or a special marker for negative existence. The existential marker can be used for the expression of other functions, such as aspect, as long as it is **not** identical to the copula of identity or attribution (""God **is** Jesus"" and ""God **is** great""). The existential element need not fulfilled all formal criteria for being a ""verb"". The existence of a negative existential alone is not sufficient for a 1, locational/positional verbs are also not enough for a 1."	verb, copula, auxiliary	verb classification, predication	particle, auxiliary, absence vs. presence	Hedvig
GB127	Are different posture verbs used obligatorily depending on an inanimate locatum's shape or position (e.g. 'to lie' vs. 'to stand')?	1: present, 0: absent					English would receive 0 here, as you can simply say that 'a bottle is on the table'. Dutch would be coded as 1, as you always have to specify whether an object 'stands' or 'lies' on the table (you cannot say that it 'is' on the table). Different configurations are possible, however (e.g. 'sit' vs. 'stand', 'hang' vs. 'lie' vs. 'stand'). Note that this feature does not concern morphological (or other overt) marking for position or shape, but really the use of different verbs for this purpose (in other words, suppletion). If the posture verbs are clearly dominant in frequency this is sufficient to count as 'obligatory' for the purpose of this question, even if non-posture alternatives are grammatical.	verb	verb classification, nominal classification, predication	suppletion, conjugation	Jakob
GB129	Is there a notably small number, i.e. about 100 or less, of verb roots in the language?	1: present, 0: absent					"Some languages have verb few members of the word class which is most commonly known as ""verbs"". In such languages, it is typically the case that what is described by one verb in other languages is instead expressed by so called ""light verb constructions"" (GB123), e.g., 'do meeting' for 'meet'. If a language has a small number of verbs in this sense, typically it will says that there is a closed class of verbs and a large part of the grammar will be devoted to the constructions whereby a verb from the closed class combines with an open-class item to form the predicate in most sentences. If the grammar never remarks on the size of the verbal inventory this almost always means that the language does not have a small number of verbs in the sense of the present question."	verb	verb classification	inventory	Hedvig
GB130	What is the pragmatically unmarked order of S and V in intransitive clauses?	multistate 1: SV; 2: VS; 3: both					All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider 'left or right-dislocation', accompanied by intonational signals or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts and the position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored.	clause	predication	word order	Hannah
GB131	Is a pragmatically unmarked constituent order verb-initial for transitive clauses?	1: present, 0: absent					All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns).

If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts and the position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored. Any other constituents other than the core arguments (A, P, V) of a transitive clause should be ignored.	clause	predication	word order	Hannah
GB132	Is a pragmatically unmarked constituent order verb-medial for transitive clauses?	1: present, 0: absent					All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider 'left or right-dislocation', accompanied by intonational signals or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts and the position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored. Any other constituents other than the core arguments (A, P, V) of a transitive clause should be ignored.	clause	predication	word order	Hannah
GB133	Is a pragmatically unmarked constituent order verb-final for transitive clauses?	1: present, 0: absent					All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider 'left or right-dislocation', accompanied by intonational signals or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts and the position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored. Any other constituents other than the core arguments (A, P, V) of a transitive clause should be ignored.	clause	predication	word order	Hannah
GB134	Is the order of constituents the same in main and subordinate clauses?	1: present, 0: absent					Whatever the order in main clauses is, does it change in subordinate clauses? For example, is the order between woman/man/chases the same in 'the woman chases the man' versus 'I think that the woman chases the man'. It is sufficient for a 1 if there are different options in subordinate clauses that are not available in main clauses.	clause	predication, subordination	word order	Hannah
GB135	Do clausal objects usually occur in the same position as nominal objects?	1: present, 0: absent					By clausal objects here we mean clauses that are directly governed by a finite verb (typically verbs of 'wanting', 'saying' etc.). In other words, complement subordinate clauses and not relative clauses. For example, _I like apples_ (nominal object) versus _I like that you play the piano every morning_ (clausal object) are in the same position (SVO). Many of the languages that do change are SOV languages that have SVO for (long) clausal objects. The question aims at discerning whether they are treated like prototypical nominal direct objects (not indirect or obliques). This is not always explicitly stated by the descriptive work, but an investigation into the examples and perhaps even appendixed text of the grammar should reveal this.	clause	predication, subordination	word order	Hannah
GB136	Is the order of core argument (i.e. S/A/P) constituents fixed?	1: present, 0: absent					The order is fixed if you cannot permute the order of core constituents and the verb without either i) changing the propositional content of the clause or ii) requiring intonational signalling or further elements (particles, cleft components, adjuncts).	clause	predication	word order	Hannah
GB137	Can standard negation be marked clause-finally?	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature refers to Standard Negation (SN), i.e. the construction that marks negation of dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood. It is possible that SN is used for other kinds of negation as well, this is a necessary requirement but not exhaustive. The position ""clause-final"" includes suffixes on verbs in verb-final clauses, even if it isn't indeed the very last suffix on the verb. Prefixes on clause-final verbs do not count as clause-final negation. If the negator consists of two obligatory elements and only one is clause-final, this is sufficient to count as clause-final negation and trigger a 1 for this feature. As with other word order features in this dataset, we're concerned with the order of the negative marker when the clause has its canonical intransitive or transitive word order, i.e. not cases of argument omission or marked focus constructions."	particle, clause, verb	TAM, negation	conjugation, word order, particle	Hannah
GB138	Can standard negation be marked clause-initially?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature refers to Standard Negation (SN), i.e. the construction that marks negation of dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood. It is possible that SN is used for other kinds of negation as well, this is a necessary requirement but not exhaustive. This includes prefixes on clause-initial verbs, but suffixes on clause-initial verbs do not count as clause-initial negation. If the negator consists of two obligatory elements and only one is clause-initial, this is sufficient to count as clause-initial negation and trigger a 1 for this feature. As with other word order features in this dataset, we're concerned with the order of the negative marker when the clause has its canonical intransitive or transitive word order, i.e. not cases of argument omission or marked focus constructions.	particle, clause, verb	TAM, negation	conjugation, word order, particle	Hannah
GB139	Is there a difference between imperative (prohibitive) and declarative negation constructions?	1: present, 0: absent					"Is the negative construction for declarative negation (""I don't drink"") different from negative imperative (""don't drink!""). This feature covers more than only different negators: different order, loss of finiteness or addition of new elements would also suffice. If the analysis of the language-specific researcher results in two different forms for negative imperative and prohibitive, then we are only concerned with the construction that is fulfilling the traditional imperative function here."	particle, clause, verb	TAM, mood, imperative, prohibition, negation	conjugation, word order, particle	Hedvig
GB140	Is verbal predication marked by the same negator as all of the following types of predication: locational, existential and nominal?	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature pertains only to the negative marker itself, be it an independent particle, verb, auxiliary, clitic or affix. By non-verbal here we are referring to locational (""The dog is in the kitchen""), existential (""There is a heaven"") or nominal predication (""Ursula is a witch""). Negation of possession, attributives (adjectives) capability or knowing are not included. However, it is very likely that languages that have different negation from the standard negator for these functions also make a distinction between locational/existential and standard."	particle, clause, verb, copula	predication, negation, verb classification	particle, conjugation	Hedvig
GB146	Is there a morpho-syntactic distinction between predicates expressing controlled versus uncontrolled events or states?	1: present, 0: absent					In a number of languages, predicates referring to uncontrolled events or states are encoded differently from those that refer to controlled events. Often, such a distinction surfaces in predicates referring to sensations (such as hunger, thirst, pain, cold, cramps, sleepiness ...), emotions (anger, happiness), or cognitive states (forgetting, remembering). Such uncontrolled predicates may be found in special constructions, different case frames ('sleep hits me', 'cramp footgrabs me'), they may form a special conjugation class of verbs or adjectives, there may be a dedicated (modal) marker for control vs. non-control, etc. The existence of verbal derivations such as passive or causative does not count as 1 here.	clause, verb, adjective, noun, case marker, NP	control, argument marking, core, oblique, verb classification	special construction, flagging, indexing, conjugation, declension	Jakob
GB147	Is there a morphological passive marked on the lexical verb?	1: present, 0: absent					Passivization is a detransitivizing operation that takes a transitive clause ('The dog bites the man.') and turns it into an intransitive one by promoting the P argument ('the man') to morphosyntactic S function. In the resulting intransitive clause, the former A argument ('the dog') either vanishes or adopts an oblique function: 'The man is bitten (by the dog).' 'Mediopassives' and the sort (e.g. 'x breaks the vase' > 'the vase breaks') also count as passives. This question targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) passive markers on lexical verbs. Anything that happens with auxiliaries is irrelevant here.	verb	valency change, passive, derivation, valency decrease	derivational morphology	Jakob
GB148	Is there a morphological antipassive marked on the lexical verb?	1: present, 0: absent					An antipassive marker detransitivizes verbs by removing the P argument or realizing it as an oblique. In a construction with ergative alignment, this means that the A argument of a transitive clause is encoded as the S argument in a corresponding antipassive clause. An antipassive marker often also has other detransitivizing functions, such as reflexivization, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative.  In practice, this feature targets any intransitivising marker that is not, or not only, a reflexive, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative marker. This question targets productive [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) antipassive markers on lexical verbs, as well as reduplication. Zero-marking or the removal of a transitivizing marker is not sufficient for a 1. Anything that happens with auxiliaries is irrelevant here. If the antipassive marker is only applied in a limited set of probably lexicalized items, it does not trigger 1.	verb	valency change, antipassive, derivation, valency decrease	derivational morphology	Jakob
GB149	Is there a morphologically marked inverse on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent					"Inverse systems are based on an animacy, person, or topicality hierarchy. Inverse markers indicate that the patient outranks the agent on the hierarchy. In a system that has a hierarchy ""speech act participants > 3SG pronouns > humans > animals, etc."", for example, 'man INV-bite dog' would mean 'the dog bit the man'. Note that in some languages, there are portmanteau morphemes that both function as person indexes on verbs and as direct/inverse markers. They would trigger 1 for this question. This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) inverse markers."	verb, index	argument marking, core	conjugation	Jakob
GB150	Is there clause chaining?	1: present, 0: absent					Clause-chaining here is not just juxtapositioning of minimal clauses with no connectors, but chains of medial clauses (i.e. formally reduced clauses that do not have the full marking that usually occurs on the verb) which are dependent on a single verb that often (but not always) occurs in a final position. This complete verb is fully specified to provide the missing categories (e.g. TAM, argument marking) for the entire clause chain. Clause chains may be referred to as topic chains, or as sequences of medial clauses/medial verbs. Crucially, this construction involves a single independent verb form, with several medial verbs that are dependent on it for full specification. Clause chains are generally used to describe simple sequences of events, and the medial verbs involved are often marked by special affixes.  Some analyses assert that medial verbs are coordinated, or at the very least not subordinated. However, it can be very difficult to determine this from descriptions and examples in grammars. Here we focus less on these syntactic distinctions and more on surface forms that fit the above description (sequences of stripped down verb forms dependent on a single verb for full specification), used for describing simple sequences of events.  In some cases clause-chaining may be difficult to distinguish from serial verb constructions. Remember that a serial verb construction involves a set of verbs or verb phrases that are typically inflected identically for TAM in a single clause, whereas clause-chaining involves a set of formally reduced clauses involving unmarked verbs, all dependent on a single fully specified verb form. Clause-chaining is also different from verb compounding, in that the verbs involved in clause-chaining all carry full semantic weight (in contrast to the light verb of verb compounding) and different arguments (e.g. objects) may occur in each clause (whereas a verb compound takes a single set of arguments as a whole). In cases where it is unclear which of these constructions is represented by the examples in the grammar, a (?) may be coded, but be sure to indicate in the comments that you were unable to determine which of these constructions is demonstrated in the relevant examples.	verb, clause	predication	special construction	Hannah
GB151	"Is there an overt verb marker dedicated to signalling coreference or noncoreference between the subject of one clause and an argument of an adjacent clause (""switch reference"")?"	1: present, 0: absent					Is there an overt marker on the verb that marks whether the argument has the same/different referent as an argument of the following clause? Some languages (e.g. Kashaya) signal switch reference by using different allomorphs of TAM markers depending on whether the subject of the following clause is the same or different. Some systems (e.g. Southeastern Pomo) only have special morphology to indicate different subjects, whereas the contrasting morphological pattern that is used for same subjects can also be used for some combinations of clauses with different referents.	verb, clause, index	deixis, argument marking, core	conjugation, indexing	Hannah
GB152	Is there a morphologically marked distinction between simultaneous and sequential clauses?	1: present, 0: absent					This question is concerned with whether there is an overt marker dedicated to signaling the distinction between temporally simultaneous and sequential actions. If sequential meaning is a secondary function of an imperfective aspect this does not count; it must be indicated by a devoted marker. The language does not need to express both sequential and simultaneous temporal relationships overtly; one marker devoted to either function is sufficient to trigger a 1 code.	verb, clause	TAM, sequentiality, simultaneity	conjugation	Hannah
GB155	Are causatives formed by affixes or clitics on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent					A causative is a valency increasing operation that introduces a causer core argument that makes a non-subject argument do or become something (e.g. 'x lies' -> 'y lay x' = 'y causes x to lie'). Note that both causatives adding an argument to a transitive clause (I drink milk -> x causes me to drink milk) and those adding an argument to an intransitive clause (I sit -> x causes me to sit) are targeted by this question. This question targets productive, [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) causative markers. Lexicalized causative verbs should be disregarded for this feature.	verb	causative, valency change, derivation, valency increase	affixation, derivational morphology	Jakob
GB156	Is there a causative construction involving an element that is unmistakably grammaticalized from a verb for 'to say'?	1: present, 0: absent					A causative is a valency increasing operation that introduces a causer subject that makes a non-subject argument do or become something (e.g. 'x lies' -> 'y lay x' = 'y causes x to lie'). Note that both causatives adding an argument to a transitive clause (I drink milk -> x causes me to drink milk) and those adding an argument to an intransitive clause (I sit -> x causes me to sit) are included in this feature. This question targets causative constructions that feature an element that clearly originated as a verb that means or meant 'to say' (e.g. 'I said for the stone to fall' to mean 'I made the stone fall'). Note that, exceptionally, for this feature, constructions that appear to be synchronically fossilized but were clearly productive in the past also count.	verb, auxiliary, particle	causative, valency change, derivation, valency increase	special construction, derivational morphology	Jakob
GB158	Are verbs reduplicated?	1: present, 0: absent					A verb is reduplicated if its root is fully or partially repeated. The word class of the outcome of the process is not relevant, as long as the root is a verb. Full repetition of already inflected verbs or whole phrases does not trigger a 1 for this feature. This feature only targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productively) reduplication. Lexicalized examples are irrelevant.	verb	derivation	reduplication	Jakob
GB159	Are nouns reduplicated?	1: present, 0: absent					A noun is reduplicated if its root is fully or partially repeated. The word class of the outcome of the process is not relevant, as long as the root is a noun. Full repetition of already inflected nouns or whole phrases does not trigger a 1 for this feature. This feature only targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productively) reduplication. Lexicalized examples are irrelevant.	noun	derivation	reduplication	Jakob
GB160	Are elements apart from verbs or nouns reduplicated?	1: present, 0: absent					A lexeme is reduplicated if its root is fully or partially repeated. The word class of the outcome of the process is not relevant, as long as the root is not a noun or a verb. Reduplication of function words counts, as does reduplication of numerals, adjectives and adverbs. Full repetition of already inflected words or whole phrases does not trigger a 1 for this feature. This feature only targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productively) reduplication. Lexicalized examples are irrelevant.	adjective, ideophone, adverb	derivation	reduplication	Jakob
GB165	Is there productive morphological trial marking on nouns?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns bound grammatical marking of trial number on nouns. The marker should be on an open set of nouns, not a restricted set. This feature is in contrast to [GB319	Is trial number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a dedicated phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB319) which focuses on the non-bound marking of trial number. For more on bound marking, please see this [page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'on-the-verb-noun'-or-'by-morphology'). If there is only bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs), that does not suffice for a 1.  Number marking is often fused with other functions, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as they don't interfere with the distinctions in numbers and as long as number marking is productive and regular."	noun	number	declension	Hedvig
GB166	Is there productive morphological paucal marking on nouns?	1: present, 0: absent					This question concerns bound grammatical marking of paucal (From Latin _paucalis_ meaning “few, little”) number on nouns, i.e. a number marker that is unspecified as to exact amount, but more than one and usually less than 10 (depending on what is being counted). This feature is in contrast to [GB320 Is paucal number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a dedicated phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB320) which focuses on the non-bound marking of paucal number. For more on bound marking, please see this [page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'on-the-verb-noun'-or-'by-morphology'). If there is only bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs), that does not suffice for a 1.

GB167	Is there a logophoric pronoun?	1: present, 0: absent					Logophoric pronouns are used distinguish reference to an individual whose speech or thought or feeling is being reported from other third-person referents. Unsurprisingly, then, logophoric pronouns are commonly found in reported speech contexts. This question concerns the existence of an anaphoric pronoun that specifically receives its referential identity from the subject of the superordinate clause in a reported speech construction (i.e. the speaker/thinker/feeler). In other words, is there a special pronominal form that occurs in the complement clause of a speech or thought verb, that designates the subject of the speech/thought verb as its referent (as opposed to any other referent)?	pronoun	logophoricity, deixis, argument marking, core	declension, paradigm	Hannah
GB170	Can an adnominal property word agree with the noun in gender/noun class?	1: present, 0: absent					For this feature, we are interested in noun classes (classes which nouns belong to based upon properties such as gender, animacy, or shape and can be identified through agreement with a modifier). We are not looking at noun classifiers (classifiers classify the noun and occur independently from other elements). This feature asks whether adjectives (defined semantically as 'adnominal property words') show agreement with the gender of nouns they modify. This should be true for more than a small class of semantically restricted adjectives; English 'blond' v. 'blonde' for example would not be enough to answer 1 for the question. There should be a fixed number (i.e. a fixed number of genders, as opposed to them being noun classifiers, totalling up to 30).	adjective, NP	gender, attribution	agreement, declension	Jay and Jeremy
GB171	Can an adnominal demonstrative agree with the noun in gender/noun class?	1: present, 0: absent					Demonstratives are modifiers that can modify nouns to mark position. This feature is looking to see if demonstratives can agree in gender/noun class with the head noun even if the head noun is not overtly marked for gender/noun class.	demonstrative, NP	gender, attribution, deixis	agreement, declension	Jay and Jeremy
GB172	Can an article agree with the noun in gender/noun class?	1: present, 0: absent					Articles can agree in gender/noun class with the head noun even if the head noun is not overtly marked for gender/noun class. This feature concerns both definite and indefinite articles. Features [GB020](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB020) and [GB021](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB021) both concern the absence or presence of definite and indefinite articles, please consider those features if you have coded 1 for this feature.	article, NP, demonstrative	gender, deixis, definiteness	agreement, declension	Jay and Jeremy
GB177	Can the verb carry a marker of animacy of argument, unrelated to any gender/noun class of the argument visible in the NP domain?	1: present, 0: absent					Does animacy of an argument (S or A or P) determines the form or presence of the indexing on the verb. This system of marking has to be unrelated or not reducible to the gender/noun class system as revealed by agreement in the noun phrase.	verb, index	nominal classification, predication	agreement, conjugation	Alena
GB184	Can an adnominal property word agree with the noun in number?	1: present, 0: absent					Adnominal property words semantically roughly correspond to adjectives in those languages that have this word class. The property word can agree in number with the head noun even if the head noun is not overtly marked for number.	adjective, NP	number, attribution	agreement, declension	Jay and Jeremy
GB185	Can an adnominal demonstrative agree with the noun in number?	1: present, 0: absent					We are interested in seeing whether adnominal demonstratives (not pronominal demonstratives) can agree in number with the head noun even if the head noun is not overtly marked for number.	demonstrative, NP	number, attribution, deixis	agreement, declension	Jay and Jeremy
GB186	Can an article agree with the noun in number?	1: present, 0: absent					Articles (a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity, (in)definiteness and information status) can agree in number with the head noun even if the head noun is not overtly marked for number. This includes both definite and indefinite articles.	article, NP, demonstrative	number, deixis, definiteness	agreement, declension	Jay and Jeremy
GB187	Is there any productive diminutive marking on the noun (exclude marking by system of nominal classification only)?	1: present, 0: absent					Diminutive marking encodes smaller size. This marker must be phonologically bound [on the noun](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence). The marker may also encode other meanings but needs to minimally encode smaller size. Reduplication, and stem changes count. This needs to be a productive pattern.	noun	nominalization, diminutive, derivation	derivational morphology	Jay and Jeremy
GB188	Is there any productive augmentative marking on the noun (exclude marking by system of nominal classification only)?	1: present, 0: absent					Augmentative marking generally intensifies the noun (in various ways). To code 1, the marker needs to minimally encode a large size of the noun it is attached to. This needs to be a productive pattern.	noun	nominalization, augmentative, derivation	derivational morphology	Jay and Jeremy
GB192	Is there a gender system where a noun's phonological properties are a factor in class assignment?	1: present, 0: absent					A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical agreement with other constituents in the nominal domain or with verbs, complementizers, or adpositions. Gender/noun class assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the phonological properties of the noun are one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of their phonological properties for this feature to be coded 1. That is, some phonological property of a noun must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. Examples of phonological properties that may play a role in gender/class assignment include tone or initial consonants. Note that noun class/gender morphology may create phonological similarities across members of a certain noun class or gender; however, this is not sufficient for a 1 coding for this feature. Phonological properties must contribute to the categorization of nouns to classes/genders, rather than simply result from associated morphology.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah
GB193	What is the order of adnominal property word and noun?	multistate 1: ANM - N; 2: N - ANM; 3: both; 0: they cannot be used attributively					"Adnominal property words semantically roughly correspond to adjectives in those languages that have this word class. We want to include elements that mark ""adjectival"" function but that might not be described as ""adjectives"", see [GB069](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB069). The question concerns the pragmatically neutral order(s)."	adjective, NP	attribution	word order	Jay and Jeremy
GB196	Is there a male/female distinction in 2nd person independent pronouns?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature asks whether the independent pronoun forms used for second person differ according to the sex of the referent. Specifically, languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature will include a distinction between male and female forms in at least some categories of second person independent pronouns. Pronouns that contrast in gender categories other than male/female sex are not sufficient to satisfy this criterion. In many languages this contrast occurs only in the singular pronouns; that is, there is a contrast between male and female forms for second person singular, but not second person plural (or dual, or any other non-singular number category). In some languages there is a contrast in multiple number categories, including singular and some non-singular number categories. It is uncommon for a language to have a male/female contrast in non-singular second person pronouns, but not in the singular pronouns, however such languages also satisfy the criteria for this feature.	pronoun	gender	declension, paradigm	Hannah
GB197	Is there a male/female distinction in 1st person independent pronouns?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature asks whether the independent pronoun forms used for first person differ according to the sex of the referent. Specifically, languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature will include a distinction between male and female forms in at least some categories of first person independent pronouns. Pronouns that contrast in gender categories other than male/female sex are not sufficient to satisfy this criterion. In many languages this contrast occurs only in the singular pronouns; that is, there is a contrast between male and female forms for first person singular, but not first person plural (or dual, or any other non-singular number category). In some languages there is a contrast in multiple number categories, including singular and some non-singular number categories. It is uncommon for a language to have a male/female contrast in non-singular first person pronouns, but not in the singular pronouns, however such languages also satisfy the criteria for this feature.	pronoun	gender	declension, paradigm	Hannah
GB198	Can an adnominal numeral agree with the noun in gender/noun class?	1: present, 0: absent					This applies to cardinal numbers primarily. A system of numeral classifiers (GB057) cannot be coded as a system of agreement in gender/noun class.	numeral, NP	quantification, attribution, gender	agreement, declension	Jay and Jeremy
GB203	What is the order of the adnominal collective universal quantifier ('all') and the noun?	0: no UQ, 1: UQ-N, 2: N-UQ, 3: both					"This feature is concerned with the ordering of a universal quantifier ('all') and the noun. We are specifically focused on adnominal quantification in pragmatically unmarked contexts. In languages that do not have a distinction between collective and distributive universal quantifiers ('all' vs. 'every'), a quantifier that could be translated as 'all' and has a primarily plural use will be a sufficient target for this feature.  There are four possible codes for this feature, reflecting the fact that the collective universal quantifier might occur strictly before or strictly after the noun, may be allowed in both of these relative positions, or may not be present in a language. A 0 code is also applicable when the language does not allow a basic construction with an adnominal collective universal quantifier and a noun (e.g. if only a floating construction is used).  Orders that result from constructions like quantifier float (e.g. English ""The children have all come"") should be disregarded for the purposes of coding this feature."	quantifier, NP	quantification, attribution	word order	Hannah
GB204	Do collective ('all') and distributive ('every') universal quantifiers differ in their forms or their syntactic positions?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature identifies languages that use different forms or syntax for collective universal quantification versus distributive universal quantification. This contrasts with languages that use both the same form *and* the same syntactic position for these two types of quantification.	quantifier, NP	quantification, attribution	word order, declension, paradigm	Hannah
GB250	Can predicative possession be expressed with a transitive 'habeo' verb?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. finite clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and a possessum. For this feature, we are looking for a verb that expresses predicative possession where the possessor is the subject, the possessum the object and the verb is finite and clearly transitive. The finite element in itself need not be clearly distinct from an existential or locational predicator, the main difference is the argument structure. Transitivity is a language-specific category that needs to be investigated separately to learn whether or not the construction is transitive. In case of languages where transitivity is hard to define it might be beneficial to compare to verbs of ""hold"" and ""grasp"". It is very likely that habeo-verb constructions arise from possessive constructions where the possessor is expressed as a topic (see feature 255).  This is known as ""have-possessive"" in the work of Stassen."	verb, clause	verb classification, predicative possession, predication	auxiliary	Hedvig
GB252	Can predicative possession be expressed with an S-like possessum and a locative-coded possessor?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. finite clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and possessum. This feature is concerned with construction where the possessum is the subject of an existential/locative predicate and the possessor is in an oblique form marked by an element meaning ""at/in/on"" (i.e. ""a car is on me"") or there is a locative marker on the verb.

This feature concerns constructions where the possessum is the subject of an existential predicative and the possessor in an oblique form marked by an element meaning ""to/for"" (i.e. ""a car is to me"") or dative case. The possessor-NP need not be overtly marked for dative case, it can be expressed in the verb itself, i.e. dependent versus head-marking is irrelevant.

This feature concerns a construction where the possessum is coded lika a comitative argument. This kind of construction is also known as ""conjunctional possessive"". The possessor is the subject, the predicate is an existential/locational/copula verb and the possessum is marked by an element marking simultaneity between clauses, or ""also/too"", or subordinating conjunction (""when/while""), or coordinating particle (""and""), or a comitative marker {""with"").

GB257	Can polar interrogation be marked by intonation only?	1: present, 0: absent					For this feature, we are looking for polar interrogation marked by intonation, and it should be the only marker in that construction. However, it does not have to be the only construction in the language which can mark polar interrogation. Intonation is our focus and not tone. Intonation is different from tonal marking. Tonal marking is bound to a certain position in the clause (e.g. the final syllable, or a certain constituent). Intonation concerns the whole clause and will have a variation in pitch across sentences and phrases.	verb, clause, sentence	mood, interrogation	intonation	Jay and Jeremy
GB260	Can polar interrogation be indicated by a special word order?	1: present, 0: absent					There is no other marker in the clause that signals polar interrogation, not even lack of finiteness compared to the affirmative.  There is allowed to be a different intonation from declarative sentences.	verb, clause, sentence	mood, interrogation	word order	Jay and Jeremy
GB262	Is there a clause-initial polar interrogative particle?	1: present, 0: absent					"In this feature, we are looking for a polar interrogative particle which appears at the beginning of the clause. The particle should be dedicated to marking questions that ask for the equivalent of an affirmative or negative answer (as opposed to content questions).  Matthew Dryer distinguished **neutral** questions from **leading** questions in the paragraph quoted below from [WALS Chapter 92](https://wals.info/chapter/92), and this feature in Grambank concerns neutral questions:  ""Many languages have question particles or expressions that indicate that the question is a leading question, one where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. English, for example, employs what are called “tag-questions” for this purpose, illustrated in (13a), which differ from the neutral question form illustrated in (13b) in that its form indicates that the speaker expects a ‘yes’ answer.  13a.

GB265	Is there a comparative construction that includes a form that elsewhere means 'surpass, exceed'?	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature identifies languages that have a comparative construction that involves a form (usually a verb form) meaning 'surpass' or 'exceed'. Typically, the standard of comparison is the direct object, the thing which is being compared to that standard is the subject, and there are two predicates: one expressing 'surpass/exceed', and one carrying relevant lexical information about the property under comparison (e.g. ""Ronald exceed be-tall Julia"").  Though this typical structure is quite common in languages that have a 'surpass/exceed' comparative construction, only the use of a 'surpass/exceed' form is required for this feature; it is not necessary for the standard to occur as a direct object or the thing being compared to serve as the subject in order to trigger a 1 value. The order of these predicates is not relevant for this feature, nor whether the property word is a verb or an adjective. The predicate expressing 'surpass/exceed' must also have functions besides comparison."	verb, auxiliary, particle, clause, adjective	comparison, predication	auxiliary, particle	Hannah
GB266	Is there a comparative construction that employs a marker of the standard which elsewhere has a locational meaning?	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature identifies comparative constructions that mark the standard of reference with an element that is otherwise locational or benefactive in meaning. In these constructions the standard NP is invariably constructed with a marker that also has a locational/adverbial function. Please note that benefactive markers are included here, following Stassen's category of locational comparatives. The marker of the property word is irrelevant for this feature (i.e. ""tall-er"")."	verb, particle, clause, adjective, adposition	comparison, predication, argument marking, oblique, locative	flagging, indexing	Hannah
GB270	Can comparatives be expressed using two conjoined clauses?	1: present, 0: absent					"Is there a comparative construction comprised of two conjoined clauses? Specifically, this construction must involve two conjoined clauses, one with the standard-NP and one with the comparee-NP. These NPs have the same function in the clauses. Note that many if not most languages can juxtapose clauses in order to make comparisons (e.g. English ""She is nice and he is not nice""). Here we are focused on languages that have a dedicated comparative construction with this structure."	verb, clause, adjective, sentence	comparison, predication	special construction	Hannah
GB273	Is there a comparative construction with a standard marker that elsewhere has neither a locational meaning nor a 'surpass/exceed' meaning?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question is focused on comparative constructions that have a dedicated marker for the standard of comparison that does not fall under the umbrella of the locational comparative (GB266) or surpass/exceed comparative (GB255). Note that a language may have multiple comparative constructions, including a non-locational, non-surpass/exceed comparative as well as constructions that are described by those features.  Crucially the dedicated marker in this construction must not elsewhere have a surpass/exceed meaning or a locational meaning. It may, however, have other functions (e.g. temporal adverb or conjunction, among other possibilities). It is irrelevant whether this marker is phonologically free or not or whether it triggers agreement in case, gender, etc.  Historically, comparative constructions with dedicated markers (sometimes called ""particle comparatives"") grammaticalize from constructions of conjoined clauses. An example of a particle comparative would be the Germanic languages, such as English ""than"". Note that the marking of the property word is not relevant here (i.e. ""tall-er"")."	verb, auxiliary, particle, clause, adjective, adposition	comparison, predication	flagging, indexing	Hannah
GB275	Is there a bound comparative degree marker on the property word in a comparative construction?	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature focuses on the presence of a bound marker of comparative degree on the property word in a comparative construction (e.g. -er in English ""tall-er""). We specifically focus on comparative constructions where the standard of comparison is overtly expressed (e.g. ""Maria is taller than John"") but also count clearly comparative forms where the standard of comparison is null/implied/inferred from context (e.g. ""Maria is taller""). This feature requires the degree marker to be phonologically bound to the property word."	adjective, clause	comparison, predication	declension, conjugation, special construction	Hannah
GB276	Is there a non-bound comparative degree marker modifying the property word in a comparative construction?	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature focuses on the presence of a phonologically non-bound marker of comparative degree that modifies the property word in a comparative construction (e.g. French ""plus grand""). We specifically focus on comparative constructions where the standard of comparison is overtly expressed (e.g. meanings like ""Maria is taller than John"") but also count clearly comparative forms where the standard of comparison is null/implied/inferred from context (e.g. meanings like ""Maria is taller""). The comparative constructions of interest express superiority (as in the French and English examples above), not inferiority (e.g. meanings like ""John is less athletic than Maria""). Superlative forms  This feature requires that the degree marker modify the property word, but not be phonologically bound."	adjective, clause, particle	comparison, predication	particle, special construction	Hannah
GB285	Can polar interrogation be marked by a question particle and verbal morphology?	1: present, 0: absent					For this feature, we are looking for polar interrogation marked by a question particle and verbal morphology, these should be the only two markers in the construction. However, it does not have to be the only construction in the language which can mark polar interrogation. Nominalizers also count as verbal morphology for the purpose of this question. Tone does not count as a particle here. The intonation of the clause is not relevant to this question. It may be the same as or different from declarative clauses.	verb, clause, particle	mood, interrogation	particle, conjugation	Jay and Jeremy
GB286	Can polar interrogation be indicated by overt verbal morphology only?	1: present, 0: absent					There is no other marker in the clause that signals polar interrogation, not even lack of finiteness compared to the affirmative, but intonation may also be different between questions and declarative statements.	verb	mood, interrogation	conjugation	Jay and Jeremy
GB291	Can polar interrogation be marked by tone?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature deals with the presence or absence of a construction where the only difference between the interrogative and the declarative is marked by tone. Please note tone (not intonation) is the focus here which is a particle and bound to the constituent.	verb, clause, sentence	mood, interrogation	tone	Jay and Jeremy
GB296	Is there a phonologically or morphosyntactically definable class of ideophones that includes ideophones depicting imagery beyond sound?	1: present, 0: absent					Ideophones are marked words that depict sensory imagery, e.g. 'glimmer', 'twiddle, 'tinkle'. In some languages, ideophones may have different morphosyntactic characteristics from other word classes (e.g. they have different morphology, or they have no morphology at all while other classes do; or they may be extremely free when it comes to word order, in comparison to other words). They may also feature sounds that are not present anywhere else in the language. Every language probably has ideophones, but not every language has a very well defined class of ideophones.	ideophone	iconicity	declension, conjugation, word order	Jakob
GB297	Can polar interrogation be indicated by a V-not-V construction?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature concerns polar interrogative constructions where the main verb is repeated, once in the affirmative form and again in the negated form, as a pragmatically unmarked way of asking questions. The negated form can also occur before the affirmative form.	clause, verb, negator	TAM, mood, interrogation, negation	particle, conjugation, word order	Jay and Jeremy
GB298	"Can standard negation be marked by an inflecting word (""auxiliary verb"")?"	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns negative words that function as auxiliary verbs, in that they inflect as verbs but occur only with other verbs. This question aims to capture phonologically free-standing elements that inflect (i.e. change form depending on arguments, environment or such). These markers are often described as ""auxiliary verbs"" in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are after grammatical marking, i.e. dedicated, productive and obligatory marking. Pay special attention to markers described as ""pronouns"" that take TAM-marking, they are probably what this set of features is aimed for.  A crucial aspect of this feature is that the main verb should behave as it does when it is combined with other auxiliary verbs, which is often that it loses finite marking (""infinite""/""connegative"" mood). If there are other auxiliaries in the language that modifies main verbs, consider what changes occur there. Of course, if the language is isolating and there isn't much of verbal morphology this is less relevant or possible irrelevant all together."	auxiliary, negator	TAM, negation	auxiliary	Hedvig
GB299	"Can standard negation be marked by a non-inflecting word (""auxiliary particle"")?"	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns negative words that do not inflect and are not bound to the verb. This question aims to capture phonologically free-standing elements that do not inflect (i.e. change form depending on arguments, environment or such). These markers are often described as ""particles"" in the literature, but are also analysed under other labels. We are after grammatical marking, i.e. dedicated, productive and obligatory marking.  This question should be answered yes (1) if negation is marked by a phonologically independent, non-inflected word (particle), regardless of whether any other strategy can also be used to mark negation (e.g. a language that uses double marking of negation through both a particle AND a verbal affix would be coded as yes (1))."	particle, negator	TAM, negation	particle	Hedvig
GB300	Does the verb for 'give' have suppletive verb forms?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns verb(s) of giving, and strong suppletion in them. Suppletion is when a word is changed in such a way that the new word does not resemble the previous, for example English went and go. If you are unsure if a form is ""enough different"" to count as suppletion, bring it up for discussion in the group."	verb, index	verb classification, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, negation, argument marking, core arguments, oblique	suppletion, conjugation	Hedvig
GB301	Is there an inclusory construction?	1: present, 0: absent					We are looking for a nonsingular referent which is expressed by a nonsingular form (superset), and a singular form (subset). The element expressing the superset could be either a free pronoun or a bound pronoun. In the example: 'We Harald talked' (_Harald and I talked._) the free 1PL. pronoun is the superset, and included within that is the subset which is the 1SG. pronoun and the proper noun 'Harald.' In some languages, this may be expressed by associative duals and plurals. This feature includes implicit inclusory constructions (as seen above) and explicit inclusory constructions which may have an overt inclusory marker in the construction to further mark the inclusory construction. It is worth noting the subset can compromise of various word classes such as proper nouns, numerals, demonstratives etc, and some languages also have inclusory conjunction forms.

GB302	"Is there a phonologically free passive marker (""particle"" or ""auxiliary"")?"	1: present, 0: absent					Passivization is a valency reducing operation that takes a transitive clause ('The dog bites the man.') and turns it into an intransitive one by promoting the P argument ('the man') to morphosyntactic S function. In the resulting intransitive clause, the former A argument ('the dog') either vanishes or adopts an oblique function: 'The man is bitten (by the dog).' 'Mediopassives', 'anticausatives' and the sort (e.g. 'x breaks the vase' > 'the vase breaks') also count as passives. This question targets [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) particles or auxiliaries marking passive clauses.	particle, auxiliary	passive, valency change, derivation, valency decrease	particle, auxiliary	Jakob
GB303	"Is there a phonologically free antipassive marker (""particle"" or ""auxiliary"")?"	1: present, 0: absent					An antipassive marker detransitivizes verbs by removing the P argument or realizing it as an oblique. In a construction with ergative alignment, this means that the A argument of a transitive clause is encoded as the S argument in a corresponding antipassive clause. An antipassive marker often also has other detransitivizing functions, such as reflexivization, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative.  In practice, this feature targets any intransitivising marker that is not, or not only, a reflexive, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative marker. This question targets [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) particles or auxiliaries marking antipassive clauses.	particle, auxiliary	antipassive, valency change, derivation, valency decrease	particle, auxiliary	Jakob
GB304	Can the agent be expressed overtly in a passive clause?	1: present, 0: absent					For languages with multiple passive constructions (e.g. 'personal' and 'impersonal' passives), this question should be answered 1 if the agent can be overtly expressed in any of these types of passive clauses. If the agent is overtly expressed, it may be unmarked or it may be marked in a number of ways: by case marking or adpositions, word order, etc.	clause	passive, valency change, derivation, valency decrease	absence vs. presence	Jakob
GB305	Is there a phonologically independent reflexive pronoun?	1: present, 0: absent					"Reflexive markers indicate that a participant is coreferential with another participant in the clause or sentence (cf. Haspelmath & The APiCS Consortium 2013). Any [free](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) form that expresses reflexive meaning counts as a reflexive pronoun. A reflexive pronoun can also be derived from regular independent pronouns with reflexive morphology (e.g. *him-self* in English, *lui-même* in French). If reflexive meaning is expressed with a body part noun, e.g. 'body' or 'head' ('They are scolding their body' to mean 'They are scolding themselves'), this also counts as 1. One reflexive pronoun (e.g. only for a certain person) is enough for ""1"" here. Emphatic pronouns (e.g. 'She cooked it (by) herself.') do not trigger a ""1"", since they do not express a participant."	pronoun	valency change, reflexive	paradigm	Jakob
GB306	Is there a phonologically independent non-bipartite reciprocal pronoun?	1: present, 0: absent					Reciprocal pronouns are bipartite if they can be synchronically analyzed as consisting of two quantifiers (e.g. each + other; two + two). So this question asks whether there are any [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/'Wordhood'-and-phonological-boundness-or-(in)dependence) reciprocal markers that cannot be synchronically analyzed as consisting of two quantifiers. These markers may indicate both reflexive and reciprocal functions. They need to be productive, not limited to a small set of verbs in the language that are probably lexicalized.	pronoun	valency change, reflexive, reciprocal	paradigm	Jakob
GB309	Are there multiple past or multiple future tenses, distinguishing distance from Time of Reference?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question aims at capturing productive marking of tense that makes distinctions into remoteness of time in relation to the point of reference or utterance. The actual marking can tonal, verbal affixation, suppletion or any other means of marking. Beware that it is important to tease out if the distinction is aspectual or modal rather than temporal. For example, ""present perfect"" is a kind of aspect that involves ""current relevance"", and may therefore more likely occur in recent time - but it can refer to events further in the past as well."	verb, auxiliary, particle	TAM, tense	conjugation, special construction	Hedvig
GB312	Is there overt morphological marking on the verb dedicated to mood?	1: present, 0: absent					This question is concerned with bound marking on the verb root that denotes grammatical mood. This feature covers all grammatical moods (the relationship between the referred event/state/action and other possible worlds, or speaker's attitude) and aims to capture phonologically bound elements.  While negation or interrogation can be considered as grammatical moods, they are not included in this feature.	verb	TAM, mood, modality	conjugation	Hedvig
GB313	Are there special adnominal possessive pronouns that are not formed by an otherwise regular process?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature identifies phonologically independent possessive pronouns that are not formed by the application of regular possessive or core case marking to more general pronominal forms. Instead, languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature form at least some possessive pronouns through some process other than the usual possessive marking, or, frequently, with suppletive forms. Note that special adnominal possessive pronouns are most commonly found in the 1st and 2nd person.  To qualify as 'special adnominal possessive pronouns', the possessive pronouns must not be identical to the pronominal forms used for core arguments. It is not necessary for the possessive pronouns to be dedicated solely to the function of possession, provided that the criteria above are satisfied.	pronoun	attributive possession, attribution, genitive	declension, flagging, paradigm	Hannah
GB314	Can augmentative meaning be expressed productively by a shift of gender/noun class?	1: present, 0: absent					Can augmentative function (i.e. larger size) be marked by a shift of nominal class? This needs to be a productive pattern. The system of nominal modification referred to in this question is not restricted to gender/noun class systems only. Augmentative function often also entails other meanings, but it needs to minimally encode larger size.	noun	gender, derivation, nominalization, augmentative	declension, derivational morphology	Jay and Jeremy
GB315	Can diminutive meaning be expressed productively by a shift of gender/noun class?	1: present, 0: absent					Can diminutive function (i.e. smaller size) be marked by a shift of noun class? We are looking for morphemes in the sentence which vary depending on the noun used, and that one of these morphemes can be used to change the meaning of a noun by adding the meaning 'small'. These morphemes should be a closed class of under about 30 (our definition of a gender system). This needs to be a productive pattern. Diminutive function often also entails other meanings, but it needs to minimally encode smaller size.	noun	gender, derivation, nominalization, diminutive	declension, derivational morphology	Jay and Jeremy
GB316	Is singular number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns regular marking of singular number in the noun phrase by a marker that is not bound to the noun, but free-standing. The marking should be on an open set of nouns, not a restricted set.

The marking should be on an open set of nouns, not a restricted set. This feature is in contrast to [GB166 Is there productive morphological paucal marking on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB166)) which focusses on the bound marking of singular number.

GB321	Is there a large class of nouns whose gender/noun class is not phonologically or semantically predictable?	1: present, 0: absent					A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical agreement with other constituents in the nominal domain or with verbs, complementizers, or adpositions. This feature asks whether there is a large or open class of nouns whose gender/noun class assignment is not predictable based on phonology or semantics. In other words, such a class will appear to be assigned arbitrarily.	noun	gender	declension	Hannah
GB322	Is there grammatical marking of direct evidence (perceived with the senses)?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question is concerned with the marking of evidentiality related to the speaker's direct sensory evidence for some event or action. Grammatical marking of evidentials involves the use of grammaticalized markers such as affixes or other morphology, evidential particles, or evidential auxiliary verbs to convey the evidential meaning, in contrast to constructions that create this meaning by the use of adverbs (e.g. ""John apparently ate the cake"") or lexical verbs in multi-clausal constructions (e.g. ""I saw that John had eaten the cake""). Visual evidence is a common form of information encoded with a direct evidential, however direct evidentiality may also include auditory or other non-visual categories of sensory evidence. This question should be answered 'yes' (1) if the language has a single direct evidential or any number of sensory evidentials."	verb, auxiliary, particle	TAM, evidentiality	conjugation, particle	Hannah

GB324	Is there an interrogative verb for content interrogatives (who?, what?, etc.)?	1: present, 0: absent					Interrogative verbs are verbs that include a semantic wh-element. In other words, the semantic content of interrogative verb roots includes an element equivalent to a content question, e.g., meaning 'to do what' or 'to be who'. The wh-element needs to behave like a verb in the language, e.g., if the language is English, it should take verbal morphology, appearing, e.g., as in 'you what-ed yesterday?' (to mean 'you did what yesterday?'). The feature does not include verbs of asking or interrogative forms created through affixation of interrogative markers to non-interrogative verb roots.	verb, interrogative	mood, interrogation	conjugation, paradigm	Hannah
GB325	Is there a count/mass distinction in interrogative quantifiers?	1: present, 0: absent					For example, English contrasts 'how many' versus 'how much'.	interrogative	mood, interrogation, quantification	paradigm, declension	Hannah
GB326	Do (nominal) content interrogatives normally or frequently occur in situ?	1: present, 0: absent					In situ means the normal position for a non-interrogative NP in the same participant role. This question is concerned with the use of in-situ content interrogative nominals as a general question construction. This question should be answered yes (1) if questions formed with in-situ interrogatives are pragmatically unmarked and are used commonly (e.g. not only in restrictive contexts such as echo questions or constructions with multiple interrogatives).	interrogative, clause	mood, interrogation	word order	Hannah
GB327	Can the relative clause follow the noun?	1: present, 0: absent					Can (non-correlative) relative clauses immediately follow the noun they modify (e.g. '[The woman who has a green hat] is tall')? This question only concerns relative clauses that immediately follow the noun, without requiring an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause - which would make them correlative relative clauses (e.g. '[The woman who has a green hat] she is tall') (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)).	clause, NP	relativization	word order	Jakob
GB328	Can the relative clause precede the noun?	1: present, 0: absent					Can (non-correlative) relative clauses immediately precede the noun they modify (e.g. '[Who has a green hat the woman] is tall')? This question only concerns relative clauses that immediately precede the noun, without requiring an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause - which would make them correlative relative clauses (e.g. 'I saw her [who has a green hat the woman]') (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)).	clause, NP	relativization	word order	Jakob
GB329	Are there internally-headed relative clauses?	1: present, 0: absent					Is a relativized noun morphosyntactically part of the relative clause? This could mean different things in different languages. In some languages, for example, the relativized noun may literally be inside the relative clause, in terms of placement ('[A green hat the woman has] is tall' to mean 'The woman who has a green hat is tall'). In other languages, the noun may receive case marking for its function inside the relative clause rather than its function inside the main clause (e.g. 'man-SUBJ greeted [woman-SUBJ who has a green hat]' as opposed to 'man-SUBJ greeted [woman-OBJ who has a green hat]). Do not consider correlative relative clauses here (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)). It must be possible for the head noun to be any noun, not only an unspecific (pro)noun (e.g., whoever).	clause, NP	relativization	word order	Jakob
GB330	Are there correlative relative clauses?	1: present, 0: absent					Are there relative clauses that require an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause? For example, '[The woman who has a green hat] she is tall.'	clause, NP	relativization	word order	Jakob
GB331	Are there adjoined relative clauses?	1: present, 0: absent					Is there a (non-correlative) relative clause that is not adjacent to its modified noun? For example, in 'The woman is tall [who has a green hat]', the noun (woman) is not adjacent to its modifying relative clause (who has a green hat). It must be possible for the head noun to be any noun, not only an unspecific (pro)noun (e.g., whoever). Do not consider correlative relative clauses for this feature (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)).	clause, NP	relativization	word order	Jakob
GB333	Is there a decimal numeral system?	1: present, 0: absent					Are some multiples of 10 starting from 30 formed with a decimal base? e.g. 30 = 3x10, 40 = 4x10, etc. Or are expressions between these decimals (20-30, 30-40, etc.) formed as 20+1, 20+2, .., 20+9; 30+1, 30+2, .., 30+9? The coding should reflect the earliest attested (i.e. not merely inferred) stage so if a pre-borrowing stage is attested, this should be coded.	numeral	quantification	paradigm	Jakob
GB334	Is there synchronic evidence for any element of a quinary numeral system?	1: present, 0: absent					Are some numerals above 5 formed with 5 as a base? For example, 6 = 5+1, 7 = 7+2, 8 = 5+3, 9 = 5+4, 11 = 5+5+1, etc.? One example of this is enough for a 1.	numeral	quantification	paradigm	Jakob
GB335	Is there synchronic evidence for any element of a vigesimal numeral system?	1: present, 0: absent					Are some numerals for multiples of 20 expressed using a base-20 system? (e.g. 40 = 2x20; 60 = 3x20; 80 = 4x20; 120 = 6x20, etc.) Or are numerals in between these multiples of 20 formed as 20+1, 20+2, .., 20+19; 40+1, 40+2, .., 40+19, etc.?	numeral	quantification	paradigm	Jakob
GB336	Is there a body-part tallying system?	1: present, 0: absent					Body part tallying systems are counting systems that use body parts other than hands, feet, fingers or toes. Counting starts from one hand, tallying parts of the body along the arm, up to the head and then continuing with symmetric tally points down the other side of the body. Body tallying systems are usually only be used in some social situations, such as traditional bride price negotiations. If the words for head or body mean 10/20, or eye means 1, and the system could be interpreted as decimal or vigesimal, this does not indicate a body part tallying system.	numeral	quantification	paradigm	Jakob
GB400	Are all person categories neutralized in some voice, tense, aspect, mood and/or negation?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns languages with obligatory indexing of the person of the argument somewhere in the clause (i.e. either on the verb or by clitics). The question asks whether the markers are deleted under certain circumstances. In order for there to be neutralization, there needs to be something to ""neutralize"" to begin with, i.e. languages without marking of person anywhere in the clause should be coded ""0"" for this feature. For this question do not consider independent pronouns."	verb, pronoun, particle, auxiliary, index	person, valency change, TAM, passive, antipassive, tense, aspect, mood, modality, negation, argument marking, core arguments	conjugation, paradigm, indexing	Alena
GB401	Is there a class of patient-labile verbs?	1: present, 0: absent					This quote from [Kulikov and Lavidas (2008)](http://www.fabula.org/actualites/typology-of-labile-verbs-focus-on-diachrony_27119.php) serves as a very good clarification. For this question we are only interested in P-labile verbs, not A-labile verbs.  _The term ‘labileʼ refers to verbs or verbal forms which can show valency alternation, i.e. changes in syntactic pattern, with no formal change in the verb. Very often (but not always) the term ‘labileʼ is only employed to refer to verbs (or verbal forms) which can be employed both transitively and intransitively, as in (1-2); some scholars use other, less widely accepted terms in this sense, such as ‘ambitransitiveʼ (R. M. W. Dixon 1994) or ‘optionally transitive' (J. G. Miller 1993):_  (1) English ``` a. John broke the vase. b. The vase broke. ```` (2) Greek ``` a. O         Janis      efage   mesimeriano. the:NOM   Janis:NOM  ate:3SG lunch:ACC 'Janis ate lunch.'  b. O        Janis      efage. the:NOM  Janis:NOM  ate:3SG 'Janis ate.' ```  (1) exemplifies patient-preserving lability (P-lability), while (2) illustrates an agent-preserving lability (A-lability), which is not relevant for this question.	verb	valency change, verb classification	none	Alena
GB402	Does the verb for 'see' have suppletive verb forms?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns verb(s) of seeing/watching/looking, and strong suppletion in them. Suppletion is when a word is changed in such a way that the new word does not resemble the previous, for example English _went_ and _go_. If you are unsure if a form is ""enough different"" to count as suppletion, bring it up for discussion in the group.  Please note that we are not interested in words that are translated to ""look for"", ""seek"" etc. This feature is concerned with the transitive verb of the acting fo seeing, not metaphorical extensions such as ""seek up""."	verb	verb classification, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, negation, argument marking, core arguments, oblique	suppletion, conjugation	Hedvig
GB403	Does the verb for 'come' have suppletive verb forms?	1: present, 0: absent					"This question concerns verb(s) of coming, and strong suppletion in them. Suppletion is when a word is changed in such a way that the new word does not resemble the previous, for example English _went_ and _go_. If you are unsure if a form is ""enough different"" to count as suppletion, bring it up for discussion in the group."	verb	verb classification, TAM, tense, aspect, mood, modality, negation, argument marking, core arguments, oblique	suppletion, conjugation	Hedvig
GB408	Is there any accusative alignment of flagging?	1: present, 0: absent					"Do S, A, and P arguments differ in terms of flagging (case and adposition marking)? Reply with ""1"" if any of the flagging subsystems (e.g. only nouns or only pronouns, or a particular tense or person) shows accusative alignment.  Although alignment types are occasionally associated with entire languages (e.g. when one says that ""Dyirbal is an ergative language""), they in fact apply only to individual constructions. The constructions which can be observed in almost every clause are  flagging and indexing.  Flagging is a relatively new term (introduced in Haspelmath 2005). It covers any kind of argument marking on the argument itself. It includes what is traditionally referred to as case or adposition marking or by a more general term of *dependent marking* (on the clause level) (Nichols 1986).  Indexing (covered in GB089-GB094) is the marking of arguments on the verb. It is often referred to as agreement or cross-referencing or pronominal marking or head marking on the clause level in Nichols' terms."	noun, NP, case marker, adposition	argument marking, core arguments	flagging, declension	Alena
GB409	Is there any ergative alignment of flagging?	1: present, 0: absent					"Do S, P, and A arguments differ in terms of flagging (case and adposition marking)? Reply with ""1"" if any of the flagging subsystems (e.g. a particular tense or person) shows ergative alignment.  Although alignment types are occasionally associated with entire languages (e.g. when one says that ""Dyirbal is an ergative language""), they in fact apply only to individual constructions.

GB410	Is there any neutral alignment of flagging?	1: present, 0: absent					"Are S, A, and P arguments flagged identically? In case of split systems, reply with ""1"" if any of the subsystems (e.g. a particular tense or person) shows neutral alignment. Reply with ""1"" if none of the three arguments is overtly flagged (i.e. if all three arguments are zero-marked).  Although alignment types are occasionally associated with entire languages (e.g. when one says that ""Dyirbal is an ergative language""), they in fact apply only to individual constructions. The constructions which can be observed in almost every clause are  flagging and indexing.  Flagging is a relatively new term (introduced in Haspelmath 2005).

GB415	Is there a politeness distinction in 2nd person forms?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature asks whether there are different 2nd person pronoun forms that are used based on the level of respect accorded by the speaker to the addressee. In some cases polite pronouns are used to indicate a level of formality or unfamiliarity between speaker and addressee. In other cases politeness distinctions are used according to very specific social relationships between speaker and addressee, such as relative age, social status, or kinship. If multiple 2nd person pronoun forms exist in a single number category, and their use is patterned according to the level of intimacy or hierarchy of social relationship between speaker and addressee, this will suffice for a (1) code.	pronoun, index, verb	politeness, person	paradigm, declension	Hannah
GB421	Is there a preposed complementizer in complements of verbs of thinking and/or knowing?	1: present, 0: absent					"In verbs of thinking and knowing, is there a complementizer preposed to the complement? This is for example the case in English. The complementiser in the sentence ""I knew that Ashley was a genius"" is _that_ and it is preposed to the complement clause (""Ashley was a genius""). The complementizer does not have to be phonologically free, the position in relation to the complement clause is what is relevant."	verb, index, complementizer, particle, clause	subordination	word order	Hedvig
GB422	Is there a postposed complementizer in complements of verbs of thinking and/or knowing?	1: present, 0: absent					"In verbs of thinking and knowing, is there a complementizer postposed to the complement? In English, the complementiser in the sentence ""I knew that Ashley was a genius"" is _that_ and it is preposed to the complement clause (""Ashley was a genius""). In Japanese however, the complementiser (_to_) is postposed (i.e. ""I knew Ashley was a genius _that_"").

GB430	Can adnominal possession be marked by a prefix on the possessor?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where a possessor (either nominal or pronominal) is marked with a prefix or proclitic to indicate possession of an object. This frequently takes the form of a genitive prefix on a possessor, but may also involve other types of prefixes or proclitics. Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that precedes and is phonologically bound to the possessor nominal/pronominal.	noun, NP, case marker, index	attributive possession, attribution, genitive	word order, flagging, prefixation	Hannah
GB431	Can adnominal possession be marked by a prefix on the possessed noun?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where possession is marked by a prefix or proclitic on the possessed noun. In some cases, the morpheme that marks possession indexes agreement categories of the possessor. Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that precedes and is phonologically bound to that possessed noun.	noun, NP, case marker, index	attributive possession, attribution, genitive	word order, flagging, prefixation	Hannah
GB432	Can adnominal possession be marked by a suffix on the possessor?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where a possessor (either nominal or pronominal) is marked with a suffix or enclitic to indicate possession of an object. This frequently takes the form of a genitive suffix on a possessor, but may also involve other types of suffixes or enclitics. Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that follows and is phonologically bound to the possessor noun/pronoun.	noun, NP, case marker, index	attributive possession, attribution, genitive	word order, flagging, suffixation	Hannah
GB433	Can adnominal possession be marked by a suffix on the possessed noun?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where possession is marked by a suffix or enclitic on the possessed noun. In some cases, the possessive suffix indexes agreement categories of the possessor. Crucially, the possession must be marked by a phonologically bound element that follows and is phonologically dependent on the possessed noun.	noun, NP, case marker, index	attributive possession, attribution, genitive	word order, flagging, suffixation	Hannah
GB519	"Can mood be marked by a non-inflecting word (""auxiliary particle"")?"	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature covers all grammatical moods (the relationship between the referred event/state/action and ""reality"" and/or speakers' attitude toward what they are saying) and aims to capture phonologically free-standing elements that do not inflect (i.e. change form depending on arguments, environment or such). These markers are often described as ""particles"" in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are after grammatical marking, i.e. dedicated, productive and obligatory marking. Pay special attention to markers described as ""pronouns"" that take TAM-marking, they are probably what this set of features is aimed for.  While negation or interrogation can be considered as grammatical moods, they are not included in this feature."	particle	TAM, mood, modality	particle	Hedvig
GB520	"Can aspect be marked by a non-inflecting word (""auxiliary particle"")?"	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature covers all grammatical aspects (internal temporal constitution of event/action/state) and aims to capture phonologically free-standing elements that do not inflect (i.e. change form depending on arguments, environment or such).  These markers are often described as ""particles"" in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are after grammatical marking, i.e. dedicated, productive and obligatory marking. Pay special attention to markers described as ""pronouns"" that take TAM-marking, they are probably what this set of features is aimed for.  A crucial aspect of this feature is that the main verb should behave as it does when it is combined with other auxiliary verbs, which is often that it loses finite marking (""infinite"" mood). If there are other auxiliaries in the language that modify main verbs, consider what changes occur there. Of course, if the language is isolating and there isn't much of verbal morphology this is less relevant or possible irrelevant all together."	particle	TAM, aspect	particle	Hedvig
GB521	"Can tense be marked by a non-inflecting word (""auxiliary particle"")?"	1: present, 0: absent					"This feature covers all tenses (present, past and future) and aims to capture phonologically free-standing elements that do no inflect (i.e. do not change form depending on arguments, TAM-enviroment or such). These markers are often described as ""particles"" in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are after grammatical marking, i.e. dedicated, productive and obligatory marking. This means that words such as ""tomorrow"" and ""yesterday"" do not qualify as productively marking future and hodiernal past. If there are any questions regarding this, please do bring it up with the group.  A crucial aspect of this feature is that the main verb should behave as it does when it is combined with other auxiliary verbs, which is often that it loses finite marking (""infinite"" mood). If there are other auxiliaries in the language that modifies main verbs, consider what changes occur there. Of course, if the language is isolating and there isn't much of verbal morphology this is less relevant or possible irrelevant all together."	particle	TAM, tense	particle	Hedvig
GB522	"Can the S or A argument be omitted from a pragmatically unmarked clause when the referent is inferrable from context (""pro-drop"" or ""null anaphora"")?"	1: present, 0: absent					This feature identifies languages that do not require a phonologically overt S or A argument expressed by a noun phrase or independent pronoun when the referent can be inferred from context. These languages are often called 'pro-drop' languages, and the phenomenon is generally referred to as 'null anaphora' or 'zero anaphora'.  Here 'omitted' means phonologically unexpressed (we do not intend for this feature to make any distinctions regarding the theoretical status of a null anaphor). To count as (1), pro-drop should occur where the S or A argument might otherwise be expressed by an independent pronoun or full noun phrase. Specifically, pro-drop should occur in simple, declarative main clauses.  Pro-drop is not mutually exclusive with indexing of the S or A argument on the verb. If, in the absence of an independent pronoun or nominal S or A, there is indexing of this argument on the verb, you may still code 1.	pronoun, NP, clause	predication	presence vs. absence	Hannah
