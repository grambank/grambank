GB020,Are there definite or specific articles?,"## Are there definite or specific articles?

## Summary
An article is a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity and (in)definiteness. Sometimes these notions of specificity and definiteness are summed up in the term 'identifiability'. The formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone.
Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm of markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum, making it hard to define discrete categories, but to qualify as an article a marker should be used in some cases to express definiteness without also expressing a spatial deictic meaning.


## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is a morpheme that can mark definiteness or specificity without also conveying a spatial deictic meaning.
2. Code 0 if the source does not mention a definite article and you cannot find one in examples or texts in an otherwise comprehensive grammar.
3. Code ? if the grammar does not contain enough analysis to determine whether there is a definite article or not.
4. If you have coded 1 for GB020 and 0 for GB021 and GB022, please write a comment explaining the position of the definite or specific article. 
5. 




## Examples
 
**Aiton** (ISO 639-3: aio, Glottolog: aito1238)

Coded 1. The definite article is postnominal (Morey 2005:244-245).
```
mə    nan    a māt     nɛ   wā
time  that   minister  DEF  say 
‘Then the minister said.’
```

**Buwal**  (ISO 639-3: bhs, Glottolog: buwa1243)

Coded 1 (Viljoen 2013: 234–242).
```
Ma     ŋga     tekeɗ     anta    vayay ?
mā     ŋgā     tēkēɗ     āntā    vájáj
REL    break   calabash  DEF     who
‘Who broke the calabash?’  
```

**Ganda** (ISO 639-3:lug, Glottolog: gand1255) 

Coded 1. In Ganda, the definite article only occurs with adnominal numerals lower than 5. If a noun is not modified by a numeral lower than five, definiteness is not marked (Crabtree 1902: 149).

```
a. entebe	e-biri
   chair	DEF-two
   ‘the two chairs’

b. entebe	biri
   chair	two
   ‘two chairs’
```

GB021,Do indefinite nominals commonly have indefinite articles?,"## Do indefinite/non-specific nominals commonly have indefinite/non-specific articles?

## Summary
For this feature, we need explicit support that indefinite/non-specific NPs commonly occur with an indefinite/non-specific article. Three or more examples of indefinite/non-specific nominals occurring with an indefinite/non-specific article is sufficient to code 1. 

An indefinite article is a marker that accompanies the indefinite noun and expresses notions such as non-specificity and indefiniteness. Sometimes these notions of non-specificity and indefiniteness are summed up in the term ‘identifiability’. A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not be similar in formal expression or position. 

The formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone. Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm of markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum, making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning ‘a certain’. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives, and also with classifiers.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if indefinite NPs commonly occur with an indefinite/non-specific article. Three or more examples are sufficient.
2. Code 1 if there is evidence (three or more examples) of a demonstrative or numeral for 1 that has grammaticalized into an indefinite article. Look for explicit analysis from the author that they are indefinite articles or look at the environments in which they occur, for example, whether they occur in different positions depending on whether they are functioning as an indefinite article or not.  
3. Code 0 if there are no indefinite articles. 
4. Code 0 if there are less than three examples of indefinite/non-specific articles occurring with indefinite NPs and note this in the comments.
5. Code ? if it is unclear whether there are indefinite articles due to limited analysis from the author or because there are not enough examples.

## Examples

**Oksapmin** (ISO 639-3: opm, Glottolog:  oksa1245) 

Coded 1. The demonstrative _tit_ is used for indefinite referents. The indefinite demonstrative is in complementary distribution with the other demonstratives described within the grammar and the author lists examples of these distributions. Interestingly, _tit_ likely originated from the (now extinct) numeral one. The author states that this is not surprising ""as the numeral one is a common source for indefinite articles cross-linguistically"" (Loughnane 2009: 120–123, 178–179).
```
xan  tit   ox     niŋ           tup   ml         mde-xi-p=li=a
man  INDF  3SG.M  small.mammal  trap  MAKE(.SEQ) come.across-PFV-EVID.REMPST.SG=HSY=a
‘They say that a man came across (from the other side of Tekin river) to make a trap
and hunt small mammals.’ (Loughnane 2009: 121)
```

**Njanga** (Glottolog:  njan1240)

Coded 1. Njanga marks indefiniteness with the numeral one _má:n_. The language has also adopted from Sundani an indefinite article suffix _-kè_
Example 1 below shows that if there is only one house and the speaker wants to express this, then the numeral one is omitted. To indicate that an unidentified house has been built, the indefinite numeral one is used (Robson 2011: 108).

```
a. wū   bàr-kɨ̄       jòː
   3SG  build-COMPL  house
   ‘He built (one) house.’ (Robson 2011: 111)

b. wū   bàr-kɨ̄       jòː     máːn
   3SG  build-COMPL  house   INDF
   ‘He built a house.’ (not identified) (Robson 2011: 111)
```

**Limbu** (ISO 639-3: lif, Glottolog:  limb1266) 

Coded 1. The numeral one _thik_ precedes the noun when functioning as a numeral, as in (b). In (a), it is suffixed when it functions as an indefinite article.

```
a.   yaŋ-dhik     pi·r-aŋ-ɛʔ
     money-INDF   give-lSG.P-IMP
     ‘Give me a rupee.’ (van Driem 1987: 32)

b.  thik  yaŋ    la·bdzo·k
    one   money  costs 
    ‘It costs one rupee.’ (van Driem 1987: 32)
```

**Assiniboine**  (ISO 639-3: asb, Glottolog:  assi1247)

Coded 0. Assiniboine does not have definite or indefinite articles, and the following examples are very common. Example 2 may also have an indefinite or mixed definite and indefinite reading. For example, 'a boy hit a ball,' 'the boy hit a ball,' and 'a boy hit the ball.' (Cumberland 2005: 345–347)
```
a. tʰaspą  awótapi aką́n   ø-yąká
   apple   table   on     3SG.A-sit
   ‘the apple is on the table’ (Cumberland 2005: 345)

b. hokšína  tʰápa   a-ø-ø-pʰá
   boy      ball    hit-3SG.P-3SG.A-hit
   ‘the boy hit the ball’ (Cumberland 2005: 345)
```

## Summary
All questions concerning the order of elements aim to capture a pragmatically unmarked order. If both GB022 and GB023 are coded 1, please write a comment. Articles cover both definite or indefinite articles as defined in [GB020](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB020) and [GB021](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB021) respectively. In order to answer 1 for this feature, the markers' functions need to meet one of those definitions, so 1 should also have been answered for [GB020](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB020) or [GB021](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB021).

## Procedure
1. If there are articles, code 1 if in a pragmatically unmarked order they can precede the noun.
2. If there is an item which occurs before the noun which may be an article but which receives ? for GB020 or GB021, then code ?.
3. If demonstratives and articles are not well described, then code ?.
4. If both GB022 and [GB023](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB023) are coded as 1, please write a comment explaining this as we are interested in the reasons that a language may have both prenominal and postnominal articles.

## Examples


**Standard Arabic** (ISO 639-3: arb, Glottolog: stan1318) 

Coded 1. The definite article is prenominal and prefixes to the noun. The indefinite article is postnominal and marked by a suffixed /-n/ sound.

Definite article:

GB024,What is the order of numeral and noun in the NP?,"## What is the order of numeral and noun in the NP?

## Summary
This feature focuses on the order of cardinal numerals (not ordinal numerals) and nouns in quantified noun phrases. In some languages only one order (Numeral-Noun or Noun-Numeral) is possible. In other languages both orders may be possible. This can take the form of free variation (where Numeral-Noun and Noun-Numeral order can occur interchangeably). The order may also depend on some other grammatical category which is neutral with respect to pragmaticality (e.g. definiteness). If the order depends on the noun, consider only the orders that apply to an open class of nouns and disregard orders that are restricted to a specific closed class of nouns.

## Procedure
1. Consider only phrases with the meaning 'X (numeral) units of Y (noun)' in their pragmatically neutral form. It does not matter what kind of construction is required (e.g. attributive *two books* or relative *books that are two*) or what word class the root or modifying form of the cardinal numerals belongs to, e.g. *two-ing books* (verb) or *two-some books* (noun) apply to this question.
2. If the numeral always precedes the noun, code 1. 
3. If the numeral always follows the noun, code 2.
4. If a closed class of nouns requires a different order than an open class, disregard the closed class and code the order that applies to the open class.
5. If both orders occur for an open class of nouns, that is if some numerals precede and some follow, or there is a free choice or there is a choice depending on some other factor (e.g. definiteness), code 3.

## Examples

**Skolt Saami** (ISO 639-3: sms, Glottolog: skol1241)

In Skolt Saami, the unmarked order of elements in the noun phrase always places the numeral before the noun (Feist 2010: 208). Skolt Saami is coded 1.

```
tõid        kueʹhtt  sueʹjj
DEM.PL.NOM  two      birch.SG.GEN
‘those two birch trees’ (Feist 2010: 209)
```

**Assiniboine** (ISO 639-3: asb, Glottolog: assi1247)

Assiniboine cardinal numbers consistently follow the noun (Cumberland 2005: 363). Assiniboine is coded 2.

```
šų́katʰą́ka  iyúšna  žé   miní  žén    0-iyáyaa-ka  
horse      seven   DET  lake  there  3SG.A.go-DUR
‘the seven horses kept going into the lake’ (Cumberland 2005: 365)
```

**Phake** (ISO 639-3: phk, Glottolog: phak1238) and **Aiton** (ISO 639-3: aio, Glottolog: aito1238)

In the Tai languages Phake and Aiton, the numeral precedes the noun when there is no classifier, and the numeral follows the noun when there is a classifier (Morey 2005: 240–241). Both languages are coded 3.

## Summary
This feature is concerned with the order of the noun and adnominal demonstratives (i.e. demonstratives that modify the noun). There are three possible values to code: 1, before the noun, 2, after the noun, or 3, both orders are possible. Like all questions concerning the order of elements, only the pragmatically unmarked orders are targeted.

## Procedure
1. In the pragmatically unmarked order, if the demonstrative precedes the noun, code 1.
2. In the pragmatically unmarked order, if the demonstrative follows the noun, code 2.
3. If both orders occur, for example, if some demonstratives precede and some follow, or there is a free choice, then code 3.

GB026,Can adnominal property words occur discontinuously?,"## Can adnominal property words occur discontinuously?

## Summary
This feature describes an adnominal property word denoting core adjectival concepts such as shape, value, dimension, age, color (at a minimum -- many other meanings are possible) which can be separated from the noun it modifies by some element that is not part of the nominal phrase. For example, can you say ***the man** is running **big*** to mean ‘**the big man** is running’? 

Typically a language which allows this has extensive [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent (e.g. the ‘Australian type’). NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here. This features aims specifically to capture the phenomenon of a single NP whose property words can occur outside of and not immediately adjacent to the portion of the NP that contains the head. Examples of the type *I painted the house red* or *I saw the boy big* are not necessarily discontinuous, but most likely resultative or contrastive (*I saw the boy big* [as opposed to before when he was small]). These should be disregarded for the purposes of this feature.

Note that for the purposes of this feature only property words (e.g. *tall*, *red*, *friendly*) should be considered. Any other elements described as 'adjectives' or 'adjectival' in the grammatical description (e.g. quantifiers, demonstratives) should be disregarded in coding this feature.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there are any sentences illustrating noun phrases where the adnominal property word is separated from the noun phrase whose head it modifies, such as *The man is running big.* to mean ‘The big man is running.’
2. Ignore sentences which may be resultatives such as *I painted the house red.* or contrastives such as *I saw the boy big.* (when he was an adult).
3. Code 1 if the grammar specifically states that the language allows adnominal property words to occur in a position separated from the remainder of the nominal phrase whose head they modify.
4. If discontinuous adnominal property words are not mentioned and there are no example sentences that show this phenomenon, code 0.
5. If there is an extensive agreement system, exhaust all resources to discover whether discontinuous adnominal property words are possible, even if they are not mentioned in the grammar. If you are uncertain whether their omission from a grammar truly indicates their absence in a language with an extensive agreement system you may code ? and include a comment about the lack of evidence.

## Examples

**Mawng** (ISO 639-3: mph, Glottolog: maun1240)

Mawng is coded as 1 based on examples like the one below.
```
yungku       marrik manga-niki-ng     mata ma-lakpi
firewood(VE) NEG    3NM/3VE-carry-IRR VE   VE-heavy
‘She shouldn't carry heavy firewood.’ (Singer 2006: 99)

(Abbreviations: VE vegetation gender, NM non-masculine gender)
```

**Choctaw** (ISO 639-3: cho, Glottolog: choc1276)

Discontinuous constituency is clearly discussed in Broadwell (2006). This feature can confidently be coded 0 based on this description: ""Another property associated with nonconfigurationality, discontinous constituency, is not found in Choctaw. For example, it is ungrammatical to separate parts of an NP from each other"" (Broadwell 2006: 43).

This is supported by examples provided below, which show that noun phrases with adnominal property words are grammatical as long as the NP is continuous. Examples with adnominal property words discontinuous from the remainder of the relevant nominal phrase are marked as ungrammatical.
```
a. alikchi' cháaha-'-mat      ofi' lósa-y-a̱       pí̱sa-tok

   doctor-DEM:NOM   dog  black-NMLZ-ACC see-PST   tall-NMLZ-DEM:NOM
   Intended: ‘That tall doctor saw the black dog.’ (Broadwell 2006: 43)

GB027,Are nominal conjunction and comitative expressed by different elements?,"## Are nominal conjunction and comitative expressed by different elements?

## Summary
Is there a difference between the marking of NP coordination (*John **and** Mary went to market.*) and the marking of comitative phrases (*John **with** Mary went to market.*)? In some languages the only way to coordinate noun phrases is with a comitative phrase, i.e. the only way to say ‘X **and** Y’ is ‘X **with** Y’. To see whether an element is comitative or coordinating you can check case marking and agreement. For example, if X is the element in question and in the dative you get ‘John-DAT X Mary-DAT’, then X is likely coordinating. If you get ‘John-DAT X Mary’, X is likely comitative. If there is agreement, if you get ‘John X Mary verb-PL’ rather than 'John X Mary verb-SG' (just like ‘John X suitcase verb-SG’), this suggests that X is coordinating.

## Procedure
1. Determine if both comitative and nominal conjunction are overtly marked (i.e. not solely by juxtaposition). If one of them is zero-marked, code 0.
2. Code 1 if there is an example of NP coordination (e.g. *John **and** Mary went to the market*) which uses an element that is distinct from the comitative marker (e.g. *John went to the market **with** Mary.*). 
3. Code 0 if a grammar states that the language uses the same elements to coordinate NPs and to mark comitative phrases.
4. Grammars do not always explicitly state whether or not the same element is used for comitative marking and nominal conjunction. Look for examples in example sentences and in appended texts as well as in the prose of the grammar.

## Examples
**Turkish** (ISO 639-3: tur, Glottolog: nucl1301) 

Turkish used to be a language with only comitatives for NP coordination namely the _-le/-la_ marker as in _Mary-le John_ ‘Mary with/and John’. Modern Turkish also has the borrowed _ve_ ‘and’, so one can now also produce _John ve Mary_ (Kornfilt 1997: 113–117). Thus modern Turkish gets a 1 while older versions of the language, before the borrowing, would get a 0.

**Maale** (ISO 629-3: mdy, Glottolog: male1284)

In Maale, sometimes the same element is used for coordination and comitative but with a difference in the number of times the element appears (e.g. twice for coordination and once for comitative). In such cases, code as 0 because it is nevertheless the same element of Maale.

Maale repeats the instrumental/comitative marker _-na_ with every conjoined noun within a coordinated NP. To express comitatives, only one _-na_ is used (Amha 2001: 79; further examples on pp. 62–63).

GB028,Is there a distinction between inclusive and exclusive?,"## Is there a distinction between inclusive and exclusive?

## Summary
Is there a pronoun or other marker that explicitly marks the inclusion of an interlocutor? This feature is not restricted to the pronominal system but includes person [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) as well. If inclusive is marked overtly in either the pronominal system or through verbal marking this is sufficient to trigger a 1 for this feature, even if exclusive has no overt morphological marking.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is a pronoun or other marker, such as a person index, that explicitly marks the inclusion of an interlocutor in the first person plural.  
2. Code 0 if the sections of the grammar discussing pronoun systems and person indexing on verbs describe no distinctions between inclusive and exclusive persons, and no pronominal forms or indices are found in examples glossed with grammatical information including INCL/EXCL or meanings such as ‘you and I’ or ‘we all (not you)’. Pay close attention to the non-singular forms of first person pronouns and indices. 
3. If you are uncertain whether some pronominal or index form(s) mark(s) a clusivity distinction (e.g. a form in a single example glossed ‘you and I’ that is known to encode dual number but is not clearly described regarding inclusivity, or multiple first person pronouns whose differences are not adequately described), code ? and provide a brief comment describing the forms or descriptions that were unclear.

## Examples

**Southern Sierra Miwok** (ISO 639-3: skd, Glottolog: sout2985)

Personal Pronominal Suffixes:

|   | Series 1 | Series 2 | Series 3 | Series 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1DU.INCL |   |   | _-ti:_ | _-ti:_ |
| 1PL | _-tti-/-mahhi:_ | _-me-_ |   |   |
| 1PL.INCL |   |   | _-ticci:_ | _-ticci:_ |
| 1PL.EXCL |   |   | _-mahhi:_ | _-mahhi:_ |

(Broadbent 1964: 43) 

Southern Sierra Miwok would be coded as 1. The lack of a first person dual exclusive form does not affect this designation, nor does the fact that the language has first person plural markers in Series 1 and 2 that do not mark clusivity.

**Chalcatongo Mixtec** (ISO 639-3: mig, Glottolog: sanm1295)

Pronouns

| PERS | GENDER | FREE | CLITIC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Familiar | _r&ugrave;&#577;&ugrave;_ | _=r&iacute;_ |
|  | Polite | _na&#577;a_ | _=na_ |
|  | Inclusive (pl)  | _&#382;&oacute;&#577;&oacute;_ | _=&#382;&oacute;_ |

(Macaulay 1996: 81)

Chalcatongo Mixtec would be coded as 1. A plural pronoun that is unmarked for clusivity can be derived from the polite or familiar first person pronouns with a prefix, but the inclusive first person is inherently plural. There is no first person plural pro-form that is marked for exclusivity. The existence of an inclusive form is sufficient to trigger a 1 and the lack of an exclusive form has no impact on this.

**Yongbei Zhuang** (ISO 639-3: zyb, Glottolog: yong1276)

First person

| Singular | Plural (excl.) | Plural (incl.) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _ku_ | _tuo_, _po tu_ | _lau’_ |

(Luo 2008: 327)

Yongbei Zhuang is coded as 1.

GB030,Is there a gender distinction in independent 3rd person pronouns?,"## Is there a gender distinction in phonologically independent third person pronouns?

## Summary
This question targets the existence of any [gender distinction](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) in [phonologically independent third person pronouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns). For the purposes of this feature we define third person pronouns as including demonstratives. A masculine/feminine distinction is commonly encoded in third person pronouns, but distinctions in any other noun class/gender categories such as animacy also satisfy the criterion for coding a 1 for this feature. For languages with no third person independent pronouns or no noun class/gender distinctions in third person pronouns, a gender distinction in demonstratives would be sufficient to trigger a 1 here. If pronouns with just inanimate referents (or alternatively, just animate referents) agree with the noun class/gender of the corresponding noun that also suffices for 1. If a language has any gender distinction for third person pronouns but not for demonstratives, this is also sufficient for a 1. For more information on the difference between grammatical gender and social, cultural, and biological constructs or traits, see the [gender wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Grammatical-gender-and-other-notions-of-gender).

## Procedure
1. If there are grammaticalized independent third person pronouns which encode a distinction in gender, including categories such as masculine and feminine or animacy, code 1.
2. If there are independent third person pronouns that are marked for the gender/noun class of the referent, code 1.
3. If there are no third person pronouns _that specify gender/noun class_ but there are demonstratives that encode gender distinctions, code 1. Note that this includes cases where the language's third person pronouns do not encode any noun class/gender distinctions as well as cases where there are no independent third person pronouns.
4. If pronouns are used only for animate third person referents and demonstratives are used for inanimate third person referents, but no noun class/gender contrasts are encoded within the third person pronouns nor within the set of demonstratives, this can be interpreted as an animacy contrast in third person pro-forms and is sufficient for 1 coding.
5. If neither independent third person pronouns nor demonstratives are marked for noun class/gender, code 0.
6. If you are uncertain whether the categories distinguished in third person pronoun forms or demonstratives are relevant to this feature, code ? and provide a comment describing the potentially relevant categories in the language's third person pronouns and/or demonstratives.

## Examples

**Kuot** (ISO 639-3: kto, Glottolog: kuot1243)

Kuot has no third  person pronouns (Lindstr&#246;m 2002: 132). It does have demonstratives that can function as third person pronouns, and these forms index masculine vs. feminine gender (Lindstr&#246;m 2002: 134). Kuot would be coded 1.

**Biak** (ISO 639-3: bhw, Glottolog: biak1248)

Biak has independent third person pronouns in several number categories: singular *i*, dual *su*, paucal *sko*. For only the third person plural pronouns there is a distinction between animate (*si*) and inanimate (*na*) (van den Heuvel 2006: 66). Biak is coded 1.

**Ingush** (ISO 639-3: inh, Glottolog: ingu1240)

Ingush third person pronouns are historically related to demonstratives (Nichols 2011: 172). Neither singular nor plural third person pronouns distinguish any categories of noun class/gender (including animacy, noun class, etc.) (Nichols 2011: 174). Ingush is coded 0.

GB031,Is there a dual or unit augmented form (in addition to plural or augmented) for all person categories in the pronoun system?,"## Is there a dual or unit augmented form (in addition to plural or augmented) for all person categories in the pronoun or person index system?

## Summary
A dual or unit augmented form must be present throughout the paradigm (i.e. for all person categories) for this feature to be coded as 1. Both [independent pronouns and bound person indexes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) are to be considered in coding this feature. Inclusive and exclusive categories of first person are not considered separate person categories for the purposes of coding this feature (e.g. if a language has dual number in third, second, and any first person category it is sufficient for triggering a 1). A dual or unit augmented form for a single person category in the paradigm is *not* sufficient for a 1 code.

## Procedure
1. If there is at least one grammaticalized pronoun in each person category in a language's independent pronoun paradigm that specifies that the number of what is being referred to is two, then code 1.
2. If there is at least one morpheme for each person category in a language's person indexing paradigm that specifies that the number of what is being referred to is two, then code 1.
3. If the expression of dual number for one or more person categories in the pronoun or person index paradigm(s) relevant to steps 1-2 requires a non-dual pronoun or index form plus a separate, general dual marker, code 0 and include a comment.
4. If there are multiple pronoun (or person indexing) paradigms in the language and at least one of them includes a dual or unit-augmented number form for all person categories, then code 1.
5. Otherwise code 0.

## Examples

**Kayardild** (ISO: gyd, Glottolog: kaya1319)

Basic pronominal stem forms (from Round 2009: 172)

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | _&#331;at&#810;-_ | _&#331;ar-_ | _&#331;al-_ |
| 2 | _&#626;i&#331;-_ | _kir-_ | _kil-_ |
| 3 | _&#627;i-_ | _pir-_ | _pil-_ |

Kayardild has a dual form for each person category in its pronominal paradigm, so it is coded 1.

**Cherokee** (ISO 639-3: chr, Glottolog: cher1273)

Cherokee has a dual form for first person (both inclusive and exclusive) and second person pronominal prefixes, but not for third person.

Cherokee pronominal prefixes (From Montgomery-Anderson 2008: 168)

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.INCL | _ji-/k-_ | _iinii-_ | _iitii-_ |
| 1.EXCL | NA | _oostii-_ | _oojii-_ |
| 2 | _hi-_ | _stii-_ | _iijii-_ |
| 3 | _a-/ka-_ | NA | _anii-_ |

Because there is no dual form for the third person, Cherokee does not meet the criteria for this feature and is coded 0.

**Tai Phake** (ISO 639-3: phk, Glottolog: phak1238)

According to Morey (2005: 219), there is a dual pronoun _ha_ (meaning ‘we two’), that survives in some texts, although in some examples the dual meaning has been bleached.

This author further states: ""Banchob (1987: 44) also points out that in Phake, the word _khe_ ‘both’ can be added to the singular pronouns to form dual pronouns, as in hau _khe_ ‘both of us’. The marking of duality is not obligatory and only used if the speaker or writer has a specific reason for indicating it."" (Morey 2005: 219).

Tai Phake is coded 0, as this marking is not obligatory and not conventionalized beyond the equivalent of the English ‘both of us’.

GB035,Are there three or more distance contrasts in demonstratives?,"## Are there three or more distance contrasts in adnominal demonstratives?

## Summary
Demonstratives are modifiers that can modify nouns (of any type and not just a restricted set such as location nouns) to mark position (e.g. deixis or reference within discourse). This doesn't have to be only Euclidean distance (meters, inches etc.), it could also be concerned with near or far in relation to the interlocutors (cf. Wolof). If the system of adnominal demonstratives includes an anaphoric demonstrative this does not count as a third distance.

## Procedure
1. Find 'demonstratives'.
2. Code 1 if there are three or more adnominal demonstratives marking different degrees of distance, including distance from the speaker or interlocutor.
3. Code 0 if there are less than three adnominal demonstratives marking different degrees of distance, including distance from the speaker or interlocutor.

## Examples

**Thayore** (ISO 639-3: thd, Glottolog:  thay1249)

Coded 1. Adnominal demonstratives have a 3-way distance contrast: (1) _inh_ ‘speaker proximate’, (2) _ulp_ ‘addressee proximate’ and (3) _ith_ ‘distal’ (Gaby 2006: 95).

## Summary
Elevation is concerned with how high or how low an object is (in altitude).

## Procedure
1. Find adnominal demonstratives, which are modifiers that can modify nouns (of any type and not just a restricted set such as location nouns) to mark position. 
2. Code 1 if there are adnominal demonstratives that specifically communicate an elevation distinction to the speaker or interlocutor, rather than just near or far distance such as in [GB035](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB035).

## Examples
**Godoberi** (ISO 639-3: gdo, Glottolog: ghod1238) 

Coded 1. 
Godoberi has six demonstratives, which can function both adnominally and, when carrying a case marker, as demonstrative pronouns. There is one demonstrative, *he-*, with the meaning 'down there', as opposed to the demonstratives with differences in horizontal distance. Kibrik calls *he-* the ""inferior demonstrative"" (Kibrik 1996: 42):

```
ha-     proximate demonstrative (this, close to the speaker),
hu-     proximate demonstrative (this, close to the listener),
hada-   remote demonstrative (at some distance from the speaker),
hudo-   remote demonstrative (at some distance from the listener),
he-     inferior demonstrative (that down there, that aside),
ho-     anaphoric demonstrative (aforementioned)
(Kibrik 1996: 42)
```

**Hatam** (ISO 639-3: had, Glottolog: hata1243) 

Reesink (1999:60). Coded 1.

Hatam has a complex demonstrative system, including elevation distinctions. The demonstratives can be used as demonstrative pronouns when prefixes with *gi-* and as adnominal modifiers when prefixed with *di-*.

```
ni      near speaker
ma      near addressee
mo      away from speaker and addressee
nu      far away
nyo     sloping up
hu      vertically up
mu      down
```

## Summary
Is there a distinction visible vs. non-visible when referencing to items that are the same relative distance? It is not relevant that adnominal demonstratives denoting far away reference often also imply non-visibility.

## Procedure
1. Find 'demonstratives', which are modifiers that can modify nouns (of any type and not just a restricted set such as location nouns) to mark position.
2. Code 1 if there are adnominal demonstratives that specifically communicate that something is invisible/visible to the speaker or interlocutor, rather than just near or far distance.

## Summary
This question asks whether there is a [classifier system](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) in which classifiers appear with demonstratives to classify the noun. This classifier system can be symmetrical with numeral, possessive or verbal classifiers. It is sufficient if they sometimes occur. Please note, this feature does not concern gender/noun classes and agreement with the noun class, but a separate nominal classifier system.

## Procedure
1. Find 'demonstratives', which are modifiers that can modify nouns (e.g. expressing deictic distinctions or specifying reference within discourse).
2. Code 1 if there are elements that are required with demonstratives that depend on the category of the noun, and if these elements are not used in a noun class/gender system.
3. Code 0 if the author states there is no classifier system or if there are many examples indicating an absence of a classifier system. 
4. Code ? if the status and function of a potential classifier is unclear and requires further examples and/or analysis. 

## Examples

**Mandarin Chinese** (ISO 639-3: cmn, Glottolog: mand1415)  

Tseng (2017). Coded 1:
```
那     个    人     是   我   的    爸爸
Nà     ge   rén    shì  wǒ   de    bàba
that   CL   person is   1SG  POSS  father
‘That person is my father.’ (Tseng 2017: 42)
```
**Pnar** (ISO 639-3: pbv, Glottolog: pnar1238)

Coded 0. There are demonstrative classifiers but they are related to the gender system. The gender clitic attaches to the demonstrative and agrees with or references the noun (Ring 2015:108-117).
```
utai u bru
u=taj   u=bru
M=DIST  M=person
‘that man (far away)’ (Ring 2015:111)
```

**Kharia** (ISO 639-3: khr, Glottolog: khar1287) 

Coded ?. There is only one classifier that can appear with demonstratives but its status and function is unclear (Peterson 2011:124).

```
laʔ  atha  jhelob, ikuɖ=ga  jhelob  ro  ho   mene=ga cakar arbo samudar=te=jo
then heavy long    very=FOC long    and that CL=FOC  wide  Arab ocean=OBL=ADD

oɖoʔ=ki   ho=ki  ""bapre!"" gam=oʔ=ki
other=PL  that=PL wow!    say=ACT.PST=PL

‘Then at that heavy, long, very long and so very wide Arabian Sea the others all said
""Wow!"".’ (Peterson 2011: 197)
```

GB039,Is there nonphonological allomorphy of noun number markers?,"## Is there nonphonological allomorphy of noun number markers?

## Summary
Are there different number markers for a single number category? And is the choice between these markers unpredictable from the marker a noun receives in another number category? For example, are there different plural markers while there is only one (or no) singular marker? Or do two nouns receive different singular markers but the same plural marker? This feature targets bound number markers, free number markers, and clitics.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there are elements marking number on nouns (excluding pronouns), whether they are attached to the noun or not,
2. And it is not entirely predictable what the plural marker will be by looking at the singular marker on the nouns and vice versa. 
3. Code 0 if you can predict what the plural marker will be from the singular marking and vice versa. 

## Examples

**Siwu** (ISO 639-3: akp, Glottolog: siwu1238)

Coded 1. Nouns that take on the noun class marked by _ɔ_ in the singular, are either marked by *ma* or *si* in the plural. It is not predictable from looking at the singular marking to determine what the plural marker will be. The table below is from Dingemanse (2011: 110–112).

**Wolof** (ISO 639-3: wol, Glottolog: nucl1347)

Coded 0. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the singular class and the plural class. It can be predicted from the singular class what the plural class will be (McLaughlin 1997:3).

GB041,Are there several nouns (more than three) which are suppletive for number?,"## Are there several nouns (more than three) which are suppletive for number?

## Summary
Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. An example of this is English _went_ and _go_. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. Only so called 'strong suppletion' counts here, 'weak' suppletion is not included. 

Only answer 1 if there are more than three examples of strong suppletion. Body parts and kinship terms are a good place to start investigating. 

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there are four or more examples of nouns which have a suppletive forms for number.
2. If there are 3 or fewer examples, consider whether the author describes these as special exceptions (in which case, code 0) or part of a larger group (in which case, code 1).
3. If all examples only feature 'weak suppletion', code 0.
4. If there is little description of number marking of nouns in general, code ?.

## Examples
**Ket** (ISO 639-3: ket, Glottolog: kett1243)

Georg (2007:100) states that there are suppletive forms for number and gives the following examples. The descriptions states that there are more than these three, but only three are given for illustrative purposes. Ket is coded as 1 for this feature.

| singular | plural | English translation| 
| ---- |  ---- |----------- |  
ke?d |   de?ŋ |  'person/human being'| 
ōks | a?q | 'tree'| 
qo?d |  qɨ́neŋ | 'way/road'|

GB042,Is there productive overt morphological singular marking on nouns?,"## Is there a productive overt morphological singular marker on nouns?

## Summary
This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of singular number on nouns. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. Absence of plural marking does not count for a 1 here (hence the emphasis on ‘overt’ in the feature question). This feature contrasts with [GB316 Is singular number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB316) which focuses on the non-bound marking of singular number. For more on bound marking, please see this [page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.

Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still trigger a 1 code, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the distinctions in number and as long as number marking is productive.

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with number or nominal morphology.
2. If the author describes a bound marker of singular number on the noun that occurs regularly, code 1.
3. If the only marking of singular number occurs on nouns derived from other word classes (adjectives, verbs, etc.), or if it only occurs only a small subset of nouns, code 0.
4. If the grammar mentions that singular number is not marked productively, or that it is marked somewhere else than on the noun, code as 0.
5. If the grammar does not describe number marking at all and you have a reason to believe that the author may have missed it, code ?.
6. If the grammar does not describe number, you encounter no examples of number marking, and the grammar is otherwise comprehensive, code 0.

## Examples
**Akan** (ISO 639-3: aka, Glottolog: akan1250) 

Akan has a noun class system marked by prefixes on nouns that distinguishes between singular and plural number. There are 6 noun classes. These noun classes prefixes mark number as well as noun class and are bound to the noun. _o-/ɔ-_ is the prefix for noun class 1 which is singular, and _a-/e-_ for noun class 6 which is plural. Here is an example with the stem _bɔfo_ ‘angel' (Osam 1994: 120). This is an example of a 1 code. 

| | singular | plural | 
| ---- |  ---- |----------- | 
|‘angel’ | _ɔ-bɔfo_ | _a-bɔfo_ |  

**Swedish** (ISO 639-3: swe, Glottolog: swed1254)

Swedish has suffixes for plural number, but singular is not regularly marked. However, there are some instances where it is possible to analyze certain nouns as having a singular suffix. For example, the word _pojke_ ‘boy’ (Skirgård p.c. 2020).

| | singular | plural | 
|-------- | ---- | ----------- | 
| ‘orange’ | _apelsin_ | _apelsiner_ | 
| ‘boy’ | _pojke_ | _pojkar_ | 

However, Swedish is an example of code 0 for this feature. Even if there are some nouns that could be analyzed as having singular marking, this is not a regular, productive pattern. Singular number in Swedish is usually marked by the absence of the plural suffix. This does not count for a 1 code.

GB043,Is there productive morphological dual marking on nouns?,"## Is there a productive morphological dual marker on nouns?

## Summary
This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of dual number on nouns. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB317 Is dual number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?
](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB317) which focuses on the non-bound marking of dual number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1. 

Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular. 

It can be difficult to determine how obligatory markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writer describes the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with number or nominal morphology.
2. If the author describes a bound marker of dual number on the noun that occurs regularly, code 1.
3. If the only marking of dual number occurs on nouns derived from other word classes (adjectives, verbs etc.) or on a small subset of nouns, code 0.
4. If the grammar mentions that dual number is not marked productively, or that it is marked somewhere else than on the noun, code as 0.
5. If the grammar does not describe number marking at all and you have a reason to believe that the author may have missed it, code ?.
6. If the grammar does not describe number, you encounter no examples of number marking, and the grammar is otherwise comprehensive, code 0.

## Examples
**Garrwa** (ISO 639-3: wrk, Glottolog: gara1269) 

Garrwa has a suffix for dual number on nouns (_-wiya_), this is an example of 1 for this feature (Breen 2003: 435).

```
Nganinyi-wiya    bula-ngka  daba       ngubungu-na

## Summary
This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of plural number on nouns. This feature contrasts with [GB318	Is plural number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB318) which focuses on non-bound marking of plural number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1. Reduplication (full or partial) does not count for this feature.

The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. Classes of animate nouns or human nouns are large and open enough. Kinship terms however are a restricted set since it is very hard to add new members.

Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with number or nominal morphology.
2. If the author describes a bound marker of plural number on the noun that occurs regularly, code 1.
3. If the only marking of plural number occurs on nouns derived from other word classes (adjectives, verbs etc.) or on a small subset of all nouns, code 0.
4. If the only marking of plural number is accomplished by reduplication, code 0.
5. If the grammar mentions that plural number is not marked productively, or that it is marked somewhere else than on the noun, code as 0.
6. If the grammar does not describe number marking at all and you have a reason to believe that the author may have missed it, code ?.
7. If the grammar does not describe number, you encounter no examples of number marking, and the grammar is otherwise comprehensive, code 0.

## Examples

**Swedish** (ISO 639-3: swe, Glottolog: swed1254)

Nouns in Swedish are regularly marked for plural number by a suffix *-ar*. This would be an example of a 1 code for this feature.

An illustration with the noun _båt_ ‘boat’ (Teleman et al. 1999: 62):

| | singular | plural | 
|-------- | ---- | ----------- | 
| indefinite | _båt_ | _båt-ar_ | 
| definite | _båt-en_ | _båt-ar-na_ | 

**Samoan** (ISO 639-3: smo, Glottolog: samo1305)

Nouns in Samoan do not take bound number marking. Number is instead expressed by articles. Articles differ for specificity and number. Plural number combined with specificity is in fact zero-marked, i.e. the absence of an article indicates plural number for specific nouns. Non-specific plural is overtly marked. Samoan is an example of 0 code for this feature.

An illustration with the noun _fale_ ‘house’ (Mosel & Hovdhaugen 1992: 90):

| | singular | plural | 
|-------- | ---- | ----------- | 
|specific| _le fale_ | _fale_ | 
|non-specific| _se fale_ | _ni fale_ |

GB046,Is there an associative plural marker for nouns?,"## Is there an associative plural marker for nouns?

## Summary
This feature aims to cover any marking that marks that the reference contains entities associated with an entity X ('X and other people/things associated with X') instead of indicating additive plural ('several instances of X'). For example, _the King_**_-s_** _went to the market_ means several kings went. An associative plural interpretation of *-s* would be 'the King and his entourage went to the market'. This marking does not need to be bound to the noun. If the additive plural also has this function, this also counts.

The associative marker may be described as a pronoun. Comitative markers do not generally count. The marker should be linked to the person whom the others are associated with, and not the other way around. 

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is a marker of the noun (bound or free) that instead of, or in addition to, marking additive plural ('several X') marks that the reference contains entities associated with X: 'X and other people/things associated with X'.
2. If this use is not mentioned, code ? and write ""Not mentioned"" in the comment field.
3. If a source explicitly says that this use does not exist, or a fieldworker explicitly says that they have not encountered it, then code 0.

## Examples
**Zulu** (ISO 639-3: zul, Glottolog: zulu1248)

Like many Atlantic-Congo languages, Zulu has a noun class system with singular and plural classes. There are plural noun class markers that can also function as associative plurals, i.e. not denoting several entities of the same type but rather 'x and things associated with x'. Zulu is coded as 1 for GB046. Poulus & Msimang (1998: 36) write:

""It may be noted here that a plural form such as *oVelaphi* could refer to either Velaphi and his companions or associates, or it could refer to two people who have the same name – these two types of plurals are some­ times referred to as the ""associative"" and ""numerical"" plurals respec­tively.""

Moravcsik (2003: 469) gives two examples of associative plural marking in Japanese and Hungarian, these both qualify as 1 for GB046:

**Hungarian** (ISO 639-3: hun, Glottolog: hung1274)
```
Péter-ék
Peter-APL
'Peter and his family or friends or associates' Moravcsik (2003: 469)
```

**Japanese** (ISO 639-3: jpn, Glottolog: ucl1643)
```
Tanaka-tachi
Tanaka-APL
'Tanaka and his family or friends or associates' Moravcsik (2003: 469)
```

GB047,Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an action/state noun from a verb?,"## Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an action/state noun from a verb?

## Summary
An action nominalization derives from a verb and functions like a noun or noun phrase. The result denotes an action or state. In English, we can exemplify this with *the enemy’s **destruction** of the city*. *Arrive* - ***arriving*** could also serves as an example, or, in Spanish, *La **concentración** de Sherlock Holmes duró cinco horas.* ‘Sherlock Holmes’ **concentration** lasted five hours’. This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) overt nominalizers, including affixes, clitics, tonal markers, reduplication, ablaut, etc. There needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) derivation. The derived noun may also refer to states or events in addition to actions. The nominalization strategy may also derive other types of nominalization. Compounds of a verb root and a noun meaning 'action', 'state' or 'event are not action nominalizations unless further grammaticalized. 

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is an element that productively attaches to verbs that forms an action/state nominalization such as *arrival*, *concentration*, etc.  
2. Do not code 1 if the relevant nouns are stated to be nouns in their own right and not derived.
3. If nominalization is not discussed whatsoever, code ?.
4. If nominalization is discussed at some length, but action/state nominalizations are not mentioned, code 0.

## Examples
**Chukchii** (ISO 639-3: ckt, Glottolog: chuk1273)

The suffix _-ɣərɣ(+VH)_ in Chukchii derives an action noun from a verb. ((+VH) indicates that it triggers dominant vowel harmony.) Chukchii is coded as 1 for this feature.

For example, the verb _wʔi_ 'die' with an iterative aspect marker *-tko* can be nominalized with _-ɣərɣ(+VH)_. The resulting noun means 'plague/epidemic/death' (Dunn 1999:144): 

```
wʔe-tko-ɣərɣ-ə-n 
die-ITER-NMLZ-ə-3SG.ABS
'his death'
```

GB048,Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an agent noun from a verb?,"## Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an agent noun from a verb?

## Summary

An agent nominalization derives from a verb and functions like a noun or noun phrase. The result denotes the agent of an action. In English, we can exemplify this with the productive _-er_ suffix (_bak-er_, _fish-er_, *garden-er*, etc.). This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) overt nominalizers, including affixes, clitics, tonal markers, reduplication, ablaut, etc. This derivation pattern needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity). Compounds of a verb root and a noun meaning 'person' are likely not agent nominalizations. 

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is an element that attaches to verbs to form an agentive nominalization such as *singer* from *sing* and if it is not stated that the element is a noun meaning ‘person’.
2. Do not code 1 if the relevant nouns are stated to be nouns in their own right and not derived.
3. If nominalization is not discussed whatsoever, code ?.
4. If nominalization is discussed at some length, but agent nominalization is not mentioned, code 0.

## Examples
**Chukchii** (ISO 639-3: ckt, Glottolog: chuk1273)

The suffix _-lʔ_ in Chukchii derives an agent noun from a verb, and is labeled ""active particle"" in the description. For example, with the verb ‘to go’:

```
təle ‘to go’ 

təle-lʔ-ə-n
go-NMLZ-ə-3SG.ABS 
‘the one who goes’ (Dunn 1999: 138–139)
```

Chukchii is coded as 1 for this feature.

GB049,Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an object noun from a verb?,"## Is there a productive morphological pattern for deriving an object noun from a verb?

## Summary
An object nominalization derives from a verb and functions like a noun or noun phrase. The result denotes the object or result of an action (e.g. *song* is derived from *to sing*). This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) overt nominalizers, including affixes, clitics, tonal markers, reduplication, ablaut, etc. There needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) derivation for this feature to be coded 1. The nominalization strategy may also derive other types of nominalization. A compound of a verb root and a noun meaning 'thing' is not an object nominalization unless there is evidence that the noun has grammaticalized into an affix. Instrument derivations are not relevant since they do not denote the object resulting from the action/state.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is an element which attaches to verbs to form an object nominalization.
2. Do not code 1 if the relevant nouns are stated to be nouns in their own right and not derived.
3. If nominalization is not discussed whatsoever, code ?.
4. If nominalization is discussed at some length, but object nominalization is not mentioned, code 0.


## Examples
**Semelai** (ISO 639-3: sza, Glottolog: seme1247)

In Semelai the affix _pn_ derives object nouns from verbs. For example, _reŋ_ ‘to seek’ -> _pn.ᵈreŋ_ ‘thing sought’ (Kruspe 2004: 67). Semelai is coded as a 1.

GB051,Is there a gender/noun class system where sex is a factor in class assignment?,"## Is there a noun class/gender system where masculine and feminine categories are a factor in class assignment?

## Summary
A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the categories _masculine_ and _feminine_ are relevant for noun class/gender assignment in a given language. A contrast between these categories in a noun class/gender system serves as a minimal criterion for this feature to be coded 1. Languages that overtly mark only one of these categories (e.g. feminine, with an unmarked class interpreted as non-feminine) do encode the relevant distinction and should be coded 1. A language may encode other socially or culturally relevant gender distinctions, and there may be cross-linguistic and cross-cultural differences in the semantics and membership of masculine and feminine categories. A language may also categorize nouns based on other factors entirely (e.g. shape, animacy, phonological properties). For the purposes of this feature, grammatical categories other than masculine and feminine should be disregarded. 

The use of these two specific categories in the definition of this feature is meant to enable consistent coding and interpretation of data for a narrowly-defined, cross-linguistically common distinction. This is not meant to represent social or cultural gender constructs or particular biological traits, nor is it intended to reflect the full diversity of grammatical gender systems. For more information on the difference between grammatical gender and social, cultural, and biological constructs or traits, see the [gender wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Grammatical-gender-and-other-notions-of-gender).

## Procedure
1. If there is [a system of nominal classification](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) where some markers vary based on the category of the noun,
2. And if these markers are **not** used only with numerals, demonstratives, and possessors (or some subset of these categories),
3. And if these markers are involved in [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) within the noun phrase, inflectional marking of the noun, or correspond to categories of [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns),
4. And if there is a correlation between use of a particular gender marker and the categories masculine and/or feminine, then code 1.
5. Code 0 if there is no class/gender system as defined in steps 1-3 or the assignment of nouns to classes/genders does not include masculine and/or feminine categories.
6. If the language has a gender/noun class system that does not encode a distinction between masculine and feminine, but does encode some other distinction(s) associated with gender/sex, code ? and provide a comment about the relevant categories.

## Examples

**Yuchi** (ISO 639-3: yuc, Glottolog: yuch1247)

The noun class/gender system in Yuchi (also spelled Euchee) includes six noun classes. Three of these are used for inanimate nouns; the other three are used for animate nouns. Within the set of animate nouns, one class includes all animate nominals (humans, animals) whose referents do not have known, traceable ancestry within the Yuchi community. For nouns whose referents are individual humans who are members of the Yuchi community, nouns are classified into masculine and feminine categories.

Linn (2000: 371–373) describes this classification further: 

""Classification as a Euchee is restricted to people of Euchee ancestry. There are a few symbolic exceptions to this that occur in traditional tales and in some references to God. Euchee classification may come from either parent or a grandparent from either the father or mother's side. It does not matter if this line comes from the mother or the father, or if one can claim only one Euchee great-grandparent. Generally, everyone is known in the Euchee community, and so the division between Euchee and non-Euchee is quite clear. … The category of Eucheeness based on bloodline is unalterable. People of mixed heritage, say Euchee and Creek, but who identifies with their Creek family and participates solely in their Creek community still bear the classification of Euchee. Conversely, people who marry into the Euchee Tribe will not assume Euchee classification, no matter how long they have been married or the degree of participation in the community. Children adopted by Euchee families and raised in the community but who are not of Euchee descent are not classified as Euchee. Whereas the language does not allow change in category for Eucheeness, inclusion in the community is quite apparent in other social ways. … Members of the Euchee tribe are further classified by the sex of the referent, so men and women are in separate classes.""

The distinction between masculine or feminine only applies to a relatively small subset of referents, yet it is indeed a factor in noun class/gender assignment in this system so it triggers a 1 for this feature.


**Barein** (ISO 639-3: bva, Glottolog: bare1279)

""Nouns referring to animals or people can be grammatically masculine or feminine. Their grammatical gender is semantically linked to their natural (biological) gender. In some cases, the semantic link is lexically defined (sex-differentiable); thus the grammatical gender does not vary (e.g. boy, mother, rooster, etc.). However, for words like *mòosó* ‘cow’ and *námá* ‘child’, the natural gender is understood to be male when a masculine direct object suffix is used, and female when the feminine direct object suffix is used, i.e., they are ""common-gender nouns"" (Corbett 1991: 34, 181)."" (Lovestrand 2012: 71)

The semantic association between nouns whose grammatical gender is invariant and whose referents are semantically associated with femininity or masculinity (‘mother’, ‘rooster’) triggers a 1 code for Barein. The 'common-gender' nouns, for which gender agreement indicates a masculine or feminine characterization of the individual(s) being referred to (rather than the general semantics of the noun), are also an example of masculine and feminine categories playing a role in the gender system.

## Summary
A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the shape of an object is one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified to certain gender categories as a result of their _shape_ for this feature to be coded 1. That is, shape must be one relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. 

Note that noun class markers are sometimes used to mark diminutives and augmentatives; this feature focuses specifically on shape (e.g. long, round, square, wide) and should _not_ be coded 1 if noun class markers associated with some other semantic categories (e.g. masculine and feminine) are recruited for diminutive and augmentative forms unless there is some other clear shape-based assignment.

## Procedure
1. If there is [a system of nominal classification](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) where some markers vary based on the category of the noun,
2. And if these markers are **not** used only with numerals, demonstratives, and possessors (or some subset of these categories),
3. And if these markers are involved in [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) within the noun phrase, inflectional marking of the noun, or [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns),
4. And if there is a correlation between use of a particular gender marker and the shape of the referent, then code 1.
5. Code 0 if there is no class/gender system or the assignment of nouns to classes/genders does not involve shape.
6. Code 0 if noun class/gender markers associated with some other semantic categories (e.g. masculine and feminine) are used to create diminutive and augmentative forms that may have meanings of endearment or intensity in addition to size, but no other shape meanings are relevant to categorization of nouns.
7. If you are unsure whether the semantic properties associated with membership in a particular noun class or gender are specifically related to shape, code ? and provide a comment describing the semantic properties/categories in question.
			

## Examples

**Alamblak** (ISO 639-3: amp, Glottolog: alam1246)

The Alamblak noun class system has two categories: masculine and feminine. For referents whose gender/sex is obvious and culturally important, assignment is based on those semantic notions. For other referents the use of noun class markers with particular nominal roots is based largely on shape.

""These noun roots select one gender marker or the other as their semantically unmarked form on the basis of a secondary or extended meaning of the gender markers. Specifically, the masculine suffix (-r) may be used to refer to tall, or long, slender, or narrow objects; the feminine suffix (-t) may be used for typically short, squat, or wide objects"" (Bruce 1984: 97).

Alambak is coded 1 because this extension of masculine and feminine categories involves specific semantic categories based on the shape of the referent (long, tall, slender vs. short, squat wide).


**Savosavo** (ISO 639-3: svs, Glottolog: savo1255)

Nouns associated with inanimate referents are typically categorized as masculine. However, they can be used with feminine noun class/gender markers to create a diminutive meaning (e.g. to indicate a contrast in size relative to the prototypical size of the referent). In the example below, the feminine object marker _k-_ is used to mark agreement with _molo_ 'knife', which would normally be associated with masculine agreement marking. This indicates a diminutive meaning.

Savosavo is coded 0, as this does not involve the shape of the object playing a role in the lexical assignment of nominals to genders/classes, but rather involves the recruitment of a noun class/gender marker to express a diminutive meaning.

GB053,Is there a gender/noun class system where animacy is a factor in class assignment?,"## Is there a noun class/gender system where animacy is a factor in class assignment?

## Summary
A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the animacy of a noun is one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of their animacy for this feature to be coded 1. That is, animacy must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. 

Note that while masculine and feminine categories are generally associated with animate referents, a gender system that makes a distinction between these categories is not necessarily sufficient to trigger a 1 here. A gender system in which animacy is a relevant factor will often make a distinction between human or animal referents and non-living referents, and animate status may be extended to culturally important non-living entities (e.g. mythological figures) or objects (e.g. celestial bodies). A human/non-human distinction is sufficient for a 1 code.

## Procedure
1. If there is [a system of nominal classification](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) where some markers vary based on the category of the noun,
2. And if these markers are **not** used only with numerals, demonstratives, and possessors (or some subset of these categories),
3. And if these markers are involved in [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) within the noun phrase, inflectional marking of the noun, or [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns),
4. And if there seems to be a correlation between use of a particular noun class/gender marker and the animacy of the noun, then code 1.
5. Code 0 if there is no noun class/gender system or the assignment of nouns to classes/genders does not involve animacy.

## Examples

**Cheyenne** (ISO 639-3: chy, Glottolog: chey1247)

All Cheyenne nouns belong to either an animate or inanimate gender class. Animate nouns include semantically animate entities like humans and animals, but also 'sun', 'moon', 'star', 'rock', and certain body part, plant, and clothing item names.

| Animate | Singular Form | Plural Form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| man | hetane | hetaneo'o |
| rabbit | v&#243;hkoehe | v&#243;hkoeheho |
| tomato | henene | heneno |

|Inanimate | Singular Form | Plural Form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bead | on&#233;havo'ke | on&#233;havo'k&#279;stse |
| river | &#243;'he'e | o'he'&#279;stse |
| axe | hohk&#x022F;xe | hohk&#x022F;xeh&#x022F;tse |

(Leman 2011: 5-7)

Cheyenne is coded 1.

**Yuchi** (ISO 639-3: yuc, Glottolog: yuch1247)

The noun class/gender system in Yuchi (also spelled Euchee) includes six noun classes (Linn 2000: 371). Three of these are used for inanimate nouns, further categorizing them based on typical position/posture (sitting, standing, lying); the other three are used for animate nouns. With in the set of animate nouns there are distinctions related to masculine and feminine categories of Yuchi community members and another class used for animate referents (humans, animals) who are not members of the Yuchi community. The fact that animate and inanimate nouns are assigned to different classes/genders is sufficient to trigger a 1 for this feature. It is not relevant to this feature that there are distinctions within the animate and inanimate categories rather than a two-way contrast.

**Czech** (ISO 639-3: ces, Glottolog: czec1258)

The Czech language encodes three primary categories of gender: masculine, feminine, and neuter (personal knowledge). Within the masculine category, however, there is a further distinction between animate and inanimate references that determines the morphological marking of nouns and other elements in the noun phrase. For example, the animate masculine noun _muž_ 'man' requires different case/number markers and agreement markers (e.g. on adnominal property words) than the inanimate masculine noun _strom_ 'tree'. No grammatical distinctions exist to encode animacy within the feminine and neuter classes (e.g. feminine _sestra_ 'sister' and _řeka_ 'river' are used with identical case/number markers and trigger the same agreement patterns on adnominal property words). The fact that animacy is restricted to masculine referents is irrelevant for this feature, since animacy is still clearly a factor in noun class/gender assignment. Czech is coded 1.

## Summary
A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether one of these factors distinguishes plants from other concepts. For this feature to be coded 1, there must be a clear pattern in which nouns that refer to plants or some subset of plant referents are assigned to one or more specific noun classes. 

Although the semantic factors in noun class/gender assignment are not always perfectly clear-cut, this feature targets those systems in which certain nouns are assigned to a particular class *because* their referents are plants. Systems in which several nominals with plant referents are assigned to a particular class because of their phonology or due to some more or less arbitrary assignment are not the target of this feature. That is, plant status must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender. However, it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment for a particular category.

## Procedure
1. If there is [a system of nominal classification](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) where some markers vary based on the category of the noun,
2. And if these markers are **not** used only with numerals, demonstratives, and possessors (or some subset of these categories),
3. And if these markers are involved in [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) within the noun phrase, inflectional marking of the noun, or [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns),
4. And if there seems to be a correlation between the use of a particular gender marker and nouns which refer to plants or plant products,
5. And if that correlation reflects a semantic category of plants or some subset of plants/plant products as a factor in noun class assignment, then code 1.
6. Code 0 if there is no noun class/gender system or if the assignment of nouns to classes/genders does not involve any semantic categories related to plant status.
7. Code 0 if any identifiable tendency for nominals with plant referents to be assigned to certain noun classes/genders reflects phonology, historical accident, or coincidental patterns of arbitrary assignment and not plant status.
8. Code ? if you identify a pattern in which nouns referring to plants are typically assigned to a specific noun class/gender, but you are unsure whether plant status is a factor in that assignment. Provide a comment that includes mention of the relevant plant meanings and noun classes.	

## Examples

**Chuwabu** (ISO 639-3: chw, Glottolog: chuw1238)

Noun classes 3 and 4 in Chuwabu contain most nouns with tree, plant, or plant part meanings (Guérois 2015: 150). Nouns with long, thin, or extended shapes also fall into these classes, potentially because of the association between these shapes and the shape properties of canonical plant structures like stems (Guérois 2015: 152). There are some other nouns that fall into classes 3 and 4 without any obvious semantic reasoning for their inclusion in these classes (Guérois 2015: 153). The organization of these classes around plant semantics is clear, regardless of the shape-based semantic extension and inclusion of semantically unrelated nouns, so Chuwabu is coded 1.

**Bininj Kun-Wok** (ISO 639-3: gup, Glottolog: gunw1252)

The four semantic categories of gender assignment in this language are described as Masculine, Feminine, Vegetable, and Neuter. The vegetable class includes plants and their products, fire, food, some types of honey, as well as several categories like sexual and excretory body parts, song/ceremony/custom, and boats/planes/cars that are less obviously linked to plant status (Evans 2003: 200–207). Bininj Kun-Wok is coded 1.

**Situ** (ISO 639-3: N/A, Glottolog: situ1238)

Nouns referring to plants in Situ are part of the larger inanimate noun class (Prins 2011: 148). While there is indeed a pattern with regard to which noun class plants are assigned to, botanical meaning is not a semantic property around which this noun class is organized. Situ is coded 0.

GB057,Are there numeral classifiers?,"## Are there numeral classifiers?

## Summary
This question concerns whether some cardinal numerals [obligatorily](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) occur with a marker that varies depending on the modified noun. This marker should not be the same as a marker of a [noun class/gender system](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) used also on noun modifiers other than cardinal numerals (e.g. demonstratives) or on predicates. The nouns in question should be of high countability, such as people, animals and objects, rather than of low countability, such as water, sand and smoke.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if cardinal numerals are [obligatorily](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) accompanied by an element which varies according to the semantic class of the noun,
2. And if the nouns in question are of high countability, such as people, animals and objects, rather than low countability such as water, sand and smoke.
3. Code 0 if there is no mention of numeral classifiers and if their absence is clear from the data provided in the grammar.

## Examples

Coded 1. ""The numeral morphs combine with various enumerator morphs, indicating either things being counted (units of measure -- as people, trees, days, handfuls) or the class of things being counted (flat things, rod-shaped things, winged creatures). Most of the basic enumerators may be considered as bound forms of free alternants.""  (Loveless 1963: 109)

GB058,Are there possessive classifiers?,"## Are there possessive classifiers?

## Summary
This question concerns whether there is an independent [classifier](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) system in possessive constructions that is not related to other nominal classification systems such as the gender/noun class of the language or numeral classifiers. 

We are concerned with markers that signal the nature of the possessor (possessor classifiers) or the possessum (possessed classifiers). This feature applies to both pronominal/nominal possessors and markers which are [bound or free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). Possessive classifiers need not be obligatory, it may also be possible to construct possessive phrases without possessive classifiers.

Differences in the expression of individual, joint, separate and group possession are not relevant here.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there are elements which are used, but not necessarily obligatory, in possessive constructions, which vary according to the semantic class of the possessor noun or the possessed noun,
2. And these elements are not the same as markers of the noun class/gender system, or other classifier systems such as numeral classifiers,
3. And these elements are not normally used when the noun is used in non-possessive constructions.
4. There need to be at least two markers (i.e. not just a possessive marker and the absence of a possessive marker).


## Examples

**Fijian** (ISO 639-3: fij, Glottolog: fiji1243)

In Fijian there are possessive classifiers which agree with the characteristics of the possessed item. Fijian is coded 1.

``` 
a. o    tama   i  Eroni

   ‘Eroni’s father’ (Pawley & Sayaba 1990: 148)

b. na  madrai kei        Eroni

   ‘Eroni’s bread’ (Pawley & Sayaba 1990: 148)

c. na  bia    mei        Eroni

``` 

**Barain** (ISO 639-3: bva, Glottolog: bare1279) 

There are possessor agreement suffixes. However, ""they follow the same pattern as the pronominal system, indexing person, gender, and number"" (Lovestrand 2012: 76). They are not classifiers. Barain is coded 0.

```

GB059,Is the adnominal possessive construction different for alienable and inalienable nouns?,"## Is the adnominal possessive construction different for alienable and inalienable nouns?

## Summary
Is there a morpho-syntactic difference in attributive possession that can be ascribed to alienability? 

This feature applies to constructions with both pronominal and nominal possessors. 

Typically, inalienable possession applies to the semantic domains of body parts and kinship, but it is sometimes found in other categories that do not align perfectly with the canonical notion of 'alienability', such as part-whole relationships other than body parts, social relationships other than kinship, or things inherently linked to a person (e.g. a person's voice, mental states, or other attributes).

This feature targets splits in possessive marking where different classes of possessum are associated with different constructions, and where one of those possessum classes includes body parts and/or kinship terms, and possibly other categories that have strong semantic associations with their owners, social relationships, or part-whole relationships.

## Procedure
1. If there are two or more possessive constructions which vary according to the semantic class of the noun being possessed or the nature of the relationship between possessor and possessed,
2. And the difference in the construction does not consist solely of a difference in noun class/gender markers, or other classifier systems such as numeral classifiers that also apply to these categories of nouns in the same way in non-possessive constructions,
3. And the 'inalienable' semantic class associated with one of these strategies contains at least body part terms or at least kinship terms, then code 1.
4. If there are not multiple possessive constructions, or if there are multiple possessive constructions that do not vary based on semantic class of the possessum, code 0.
5. If you code a 1 for this feature, please use the comment field to provide a very brief description of the morphosyntactic distinction between alienable and inalienable possession.

## Examples

**Luise&#241;o** (ISO 639-3: lui, Glottolog: luis1253)

Luise&#241;o possessive constructions are formed by attaching a possessive pronominal prefix (e.g. meaning ‘my’, ‘your’, etc.) to the possessed noun. A suffix *-ki* is also attached to the possessed noun when the relationship between possessor and possessed is alienable: ‘my sinew (in my body)’ = *no-ta&#817;*; ‘my sinew (for the bow I am making)’ = *no-ta&#817;-ki* (Grune 1997: 4). Luise&#241;o would be coded 1.

**Nakanai** (ISO 639-3: nak, Glottolog: naka1262)

In Nakanai the inalienable possession construction requires suffixes that indicate the person and number of the possessor, while possessors are indicated only with phonologically independent forms in the alienable possession construction. Nakanai is coded 1.

```
la  luma   taku
ART house  my
‘my house’

la   lima-gu
ART  hand-my
‘my hand’ (Johnston 1980: 168)
```

**Spanish** (ISO 639-3: spa, Glottolog: stan1288)

Like many languages, Spanish has multiple possessive constructions, but each is compatible with the semantic classes of nouns typically associated with inalienable possession (body parts and kinship terms) as well as other nouns generally. There is no distinction that splits according to alienability. Spanish would be 0.

```
mi dedo               el  dedo   de Ana
my finger             DET finger of Ana
‘my finger’           ‘Ana's finger’

mi hermano            el  hermano de Ana

‘my brother’          ‘Ana's brother’

GB065,What is the pragmatically unmarked order of adnominal possessor noun and possessed noun?,"## What is the pragmatically unmarked order of adnominal possessor and possessed noun?

## Summary
This feature focuses on the relative order of possessor and possessum (i.e. that which is possessed) in an adnominal possession construction. Coding should take into consideration only those possession constructions that are pragmatically unmarked (e.g. not focus). This feature applies to both nominal possessors and [independent pronominal](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) possessors. [Affixal](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) marking of possession, by contrast, is coded in features [GB430](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB430)-[GB433](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB433).


## Procedure
1. In the pragmatically unmarked order, if the possessor nominal or independent possessor pronoun precedes the possessum, code 1.
2. In the pragmatically unmarked order, if the possessor nominal or independent possessor pronoun follows the possessum, code 2.
3. If both occur, for example if some possessed nouns precede and some follow, or there is a free choice, then code 3.


## Examples
**Nanti** (ISO 639-3: cox, Glottolog: nant1250)

```
i-banko      Ihonira  
2SG.M-house  Ihonira
‘Ihonira's house’

irashi      i-banko  
2SG.M.POSS  3SG.M-house  
‘his house’
```

Inalienable possession in Nanti is expressed by a prefix on the possessed noun, which indicates the person, number, gender of the possessor. A nominal possessor or possessive pronoun may also be included in the phrase. Nominal possessors follow the possessed noun in unmarked constructions, but may appear to the left of the possessum when they are in contrastive focus. Pronominal possessors occur to the left of possessed nouns. Alienable possession uses the same prefixes as inalienable possession, but also includes an alienable possession suffix on the possessed noun. Nanti would be coded 3. In pragmatically unmarked possessive constructions with nominal possessors, the possessor noun follows the possessed noun. The focus construction in which a possessor nominal occurs before the possessed noun does not trigger a 3 here. However, the fact that pronominal possessors precede possessed nouns in the relevant pragmatically unmarked construction (and, in fact, always when there is an independent possessive pronoun) means that both orders are present in unmarked constructions. This triggers a 3 code (Michael 2012: 151–152).  

**Southeastern Pomo** (ISO 639-3: pom, Glottolog: sout2982)

Both alienable and inalienable possession in Southeastern Pomo involve a construction where the possessor precedes the possessed noun. Southeastern Pomo would be coded 1, since only this one order occurs.

``` 
hayut     xin
hayu-it   xin
dog-POSS  name
‘the dog's name’

bṭedit      xal
bṭed-it     xal
woman-POSS  arm
‘the woman's arm’

hayutbaq        ca
hayu-it-baq     ca
dog-POSS-ALIEN  house
‘the dog's house’

Ɂuyitbaq       ca
Ɂuyi-it-baq    ca
3s-POSS-ALIEN  house
‘his house’ (Moshinsky 1974: 95)
```

**Nzadi** (ISO 639-3: nzd, Glottolog: nzad1234)

The possessor noun or possessive pronoun follows the possessed noun in Nzadi. For some classes of possessed nouns, a genitive linker *&#233;* also occurs before the possessor. Nzadi is coded 2, since the possessor always follows the possessed noun in pragmatically unmarked constructions.

```
mwàán  mǐ`
child  my
‘my child’

ǐgɔm  mwàán
drum  child
‘the child's drum’

okyá é   ǐ́kêm
tail GEN monkey
‘the monkey's tail’ (Crane et al. 2011: 77–83)
```

GB068,"Do core adjectives (defined semantically as property concepts such as value, shape, age, dimension) act like verbs in predicative position?","## Do property words (defined semantically as property concepts such as value, shape, age, dimension) act like verbs in predicative position?

## Summary
Do property words used as predicates take on verbal morphology? The predicative property word need not take exactly all verbal marking. If there is at least some marking that verbs and predicative property words share, this counts as 1 (for example, if a language has *he runs* and *he greens*). However, if there is additional morphology or there are additional elements that the property word requires, then this feature should be coded as 0. This should apply to most property words in the language. Property words semantically roughly correspond to adjectives in those languages that have a separate adjective word class. We want to include elements that mark ‘adjectival’ function but that might not be described as ‘adjectives’.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if most property words used predicatively receive markers which are used on verbs.
2. Code 1 if neither property words nor predicative verbs receive marking.
3. Code 1 if property words receive the same marking as stative verbs.
4. Code 0 if property words are obligatorily accompanied by elements which are not obligatory with verbs.
5. Code 1 if most examples of property words follow this pattern; code 0 if most do not; code ? if property words are split between this and another pattern.

## Examples

**Hano** (ISO 639-3: lml, Glottolog: hano1246) 

See Vari-Bogiri (2011: 62). Coded 1.

“Adjectives behave like verbs when they function as predicate, preceded by subject marker and TAM category and they function as stative verbs when they refer to state or process.”

**Bororo** (ISO 639-3: bor, Glottolog: boro1282)

The example below is taken from Stassen (2013), citing Crowell (1979: 26, 50).

```
a. i-mago-re
   1SG-speak-NEUTRAL
   ‘I speak/spoke.’

b. i-kure-re
   1SG-tall-NEUTRAL
   ‘I am/was tall.’
```

Since the morphology for ‘tall’ and ‘speak’ is identical, and this is typical of adjectives in Bororo, Bororo would be coded as 1.

**Irish** (ISO 693-3: gle, Glottolog: iris1253)

Example from Stassen (2013), citing Greene (1966: 46, 43).

```
a. téann   Sean
   go.PST  Sean
   ‘Sean went.’

b. is     breoite  é
   be.PRS ill	   he
   ‘He is ill.’
```

Because adjectives require a copula, the coding should be 0 for this feature.

## Summary
Do adnominal property words receive the same treatment as verbs when verbs are used attributively, i.e. inside an NP? The adnominal property word need not take exactly all verbal marking. If there is at least some marking that verbal and adnominal property words share, this counts as 1. The result need not be finite: participles count as attributively used verbs. This means that if the language in question forms modifying verbs by participles (*the running man*) and this is the same for adnominal property word roots (*the redding man*), this counts as 1. Property words semantically correspond to adjectives in those languages that have a separate adjective word class. We want to include elements that mark 'adjectival' function but that might not be described as 'adjectives.'


## Procedure
1. Code 1 if adnominal property words receive markers which are used on attributive verbs (e.g. participles or relativized verbs).
2. Code 1 if neither adnominal property words nor attributive verbs receive marking.
3. Code 0 if adnominal property words are obligatorily accompanied by elements which are not obligatory with attributive verbs.
4. Code 1 if some adnominal property words follow this pattern whereas others do not.

## Examples

**Choctaw** (ISO 639-3: cho, Glottolog: choc1276) 

Coded 1. The grammar states that Choctaw likely does not have a lexical class of adjectives and that their meanings are conveyed via stative verbs. The author states, however, that is useful to use the term 'adjective' because they show ""peculiarities not shared by other verbs."" Choctaw verbs require a tense marker. Adnominal adjectives must also take a tense marker as seen in the examples below (Broadwell 2006: 50–51, 172–173, 221–225).

```
(1) Hattak  chaaha-h  pga-li-tok. 
    man     tall-TNS  see:INCMPL-1SG.CL1-PST
   ‘I saw the tall man.’ (Broadwell 2006: 173)

(2) Hattak-at    chaaha-h.
    man-NOM      tall-TNS
   ‘The man is tall.’ (Broadwell 2006: 51)
```

**Akha** (ISO 639-3: ahk, Glottolog: akha1245)

Coded 0. Adjectives are generally stative verbs, however, when used attributively they take the prefix *jɔ-* which denotes a temporary quality. This prefix does not appear on verbs (Hansson 2017: 893–894).

```
ŋɑ̀-sjhà         jɔ-né
CL.fish-fish    ADJ-red
‘red fish’ (Hansson 2017: 893)

GB070,Are there morphological cases for non-pronominal core arguments (i.e. S/A/P)?,"## Are there morphological cases for non-pronominal core arguments (i.e. S, A or P)?

## Summary

Morphological case involves any type of case marking (or flagging) that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, etc.). [Core arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) are those having S, A or P function. If a bound marker distinguishes S from non-S NPs, this counts for a 1 code. Optional marking and marking with portmanteau morphemes (e.g. a marker both indicates that a noun phrase is plural and that it has P function) also count.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if core case is at least sometimes marked on noun phrases by means of bound markers (clitics, affixes, tone, etc.).
2. Code 0 if core argument functions are only marked on noun phrases using phonologically free adpositions. 
3. Code 0 if core argument functions are only indicated by means of constituent order.
4. Code 0 if case marking is not mentioned in the grammar or in the examples. Write 'not mentioned' in the comment column.
5. Code ? if you have reason to believe that the author may have missed case markers or specific case-marking functions of other morphemes.

## Examples

**Warrongo** (ISO 639-3: wrg, Glottolog: waru1264)

Warrongo has case markers on every element of the NP (Tsunoda 2011: 342ff) and is coded 1 for this feature.

```
ngaygo-ngomany-jo gando-nggo gamo       bija-n
1SG.GEN-ABL-ERG	  dog-ERG    water.ACC  drink-NFUT
‘My dog drank water.’ (Tsunoda 2011: 358)
```

**Mundang** (ISO 639-3: mua, Glottolog: mund1325)

In Mundang, plural is only marked on nouns in non-subject functions. In other words, the plural marker also marks non-subject case (Elders 2000). Mundang is coded 1 for this feature.

```
mè   kō   bàl-rā       ɓè
1SG  see  elephant-PL  PRF
‘I have seen elephants.’ (Elders 2000: 393)
```

If the subject argument is plural, the verb carries the plural marker (Elders 2000: 394–396):

```
zá      ngɔ̀ŋ-rā       gíì
people  slaughter-PL  goat
‘The people slaughter a goat.’ (Elders 2000: 395)
```

**Hokkaido Ainu** (ISO 639-3: ain, Glottolog: ainu1240)

Hokkaido Ainu has no morphological cases whatsoever, and is coded 0 (Bugaeva 2004).

## Summary
This question is about [phonologically independent pronouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) only; indexes are irrelevant. Morphological case involves any type of case marking that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, etc.). Core arguments are those having [S, A or P function](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). If a bound marker distinguishes S from non-S pronouns, this counts as 1. Optional marking and marking with portmanteau morphemes (e.g. a marker both indicates that a noun phrase is plural and that it has P function) also count.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if core case can be marked on pronouns using tone, affixation, suppletion, or any other kind of bound marking.  
2. Code 0 if core argument functions are only marked on pronouns with phonologically free adpositions.
3. Code 0 if core argument functions are only indicated using constituent order. 
4. Code 0 if case marking on pronouns is not mentioned in the grammar or in the examples. Write 'not mentioned' in the comment column.
5. Code ? if you have reason to believe that the author may have missed case markers (e.g. because they do not analyze tone) or specific case-marking functions of other morphemes.

## Examples

**Eipomek** (ISO 639-3: eip, Glottolog: eipo1242)

In Eipomek, phonologically independent pronominal subjects may be marked with the bound morpheme *-de* (Heeschen 1998: 171–172). Eipomek is coded 1.

```
na-de  bo-am-ne-buk,          an-de  dob-nama-lam
1SG-S  carry-PRF-1SG.PRS-when 2SG-S  take-FUT-2SG
‘It is me who has carried it, and you will take it.’ (Heeschen 1998: 172)
```

**Lardil** (ISO 639-3: lbz, Glottolog: lard1243)

Lardil has different pronouns for different case functions (Klikeid 1976: 107–108). Lardil is coded 1.

 |          | Nominative | Accusative |
 | -------- | ---------- |----------- |
 | 1SG      | _ngata_      | _ngithaa-n_  |
 | 2SG      | _nying-ki_   | _ngimpee-n_  |
 | 3SG      | _ni-ya_      | _niwee-n_    |

**Abun** (ISO 639-3: kgr, Glottolog: abun1252)

In Abun, there are no morphological cases at all, not for pronominal noun phrases and not for non-pronominal noun phrases. It is coded 0 for this feature (Berry & Berry 1999: 48–49). Argument functions are solely indicated by means of word order:

```
a. men  kas
   1PL  run
   ‘We ran.’ (Berry & Berry 1999: 49)

b. men  gwa  Isak
   1PL  hit  Isak
   ‘We hit Isak.’ (Berry & Berry 1999: 49)

c. Isak  gwa  men
   Isak  hit  1PL
   ‘Isak hit us.’ (Berry & Berry 1999: 49)

## Summary

Morphological case involves any type of case marking that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, etc.). Oblique NPs are NPs having a function other than [S, A or P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)), e.g. dative, locative, ablative instrumental, comitative, location in time, etc. If a phonologically free adposition agrees in gender, number or person with the noun phrase, it does not count as a case marker for the purpose of this feature. Note that genitive or possessive are not seen as cases for this feature.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if an oblique case is marked on nouns or noun phrases using tone, affixation, clitics or any other phonologically bound means.
2. Code 0 if oblique functions are only marked on nouns or noun phrases using phonologically free adpositions.
3. Code 0 if oblique functions are only indicated using constituent order.
4. Code ? if you think there is not enough data or analysis to say whether oblique case is marked on nouns or noun phrases (e.g. because it is not clear whether the marker(s)are phonologically bound, or nothing is mentioned by the author and there are no examples of oblique noun phrases). Mention this in the comment column.

## Examples

**Warrongo** (ISO 639-3: wrg, Glottolog: waru1264)

Warrongo has case markers on every element of the NP (Tsunoda 2011: 342ff) and is coded 1.

```

**Zuni** (ISO 639-3: zun, Glottolog: zuni1245)

Zuni has a directional enclitic _-kʷin_ and a locative enclitic _-ʔan_. No clear examples are given where we can check whether they really attach to the end of the noun phrase or just to the noun. In any case, Zuni is coded 1 for this feature.

```

‘(He went) to Gallup’ (Newman 1965: 66)

kʔakʷe-'w-an
house-PL-LOC
‘(We stayed) at their houses’ (Newman 1965: 66)
```

**Ndam** (ISO 639-3: ndm, Glottolog: ndam1251)

In Ndam, the locative of disyllabic nouns with mid-mid melody is formed by lowering the melody to low-low. Low-low nouns are turned into locatives by changing their melody to low-high (Broß 1988: 57-58). This triggers 1 for this feature.

```
būgō  ‘house’        → bùgò  ‘in the house’
gūjʌ̄n ‘my stomach’   → gùjʌ̀n ‘in my stomach’
gə̀lè  ‘concession’   → gə̀lé  ‘in the concession’ (Broß 1988: 58)
```

**Fore** (ISO 639-3: for, Glottolog: fore1270)

Fore marks allative case by means of the enclitic _=ti_ (Scott 1978: 104, 109–111). This triggers 1 for this feature.

```
pi     nkáu='i    wa-y-e
that   place=ALL  go-he-IND
‘He goes to that place.’ (Scott 1978: 109)
```

**Holoholo** (ISO 639-3: hoo, Glottolog: holo1240)

Various Bantu languages have one or more ‘locative noun classes’, which qualify as oblique case markers for the purposes of Grambank. Holoholo is a good example, having three 'locative' noun class 'prefixes' (classes 16, 17, 18 in Coupez 1955: 36, 38), which are in fact proclitics (they only attach to the noun, which is the first element of the noun phrase) and thus count as both prepositions and oblique case markers here. These languages are coded 1.

```
heelungu

LOC-country

kwilungu

```

**Island Carib** (ISO 639-3: crb, Glottolog: isla1278)

In Island Carib, the instrumental preposition *áo* ‘INS’ agrees with the noun in number and gender. When the noun is masculine, for example, the preposition carries the prefix *l-* ‘3SG.M’: *l-áo* ‘3SG.M-INS’. In principle, one could analyze *l-* as a constituent of the noun phrase, as a number-gender marker that acts as a host for case markers. For this feature, however, we consider it as an agreement marker on the preposition. Island Carib is coded 0 for this feature. See Rat (1898: 294) for examples and Josephs (2019: 51) on the agreement markers, which the author calls pronominal prefixes.

```
l-áo       akúruku

```

**Hokkaido Ainu** (ISO 639-3: ain, Glottolog: ainu1240)

Hokkaido Ainu has no morphological cases whatsoever, and is coded 0 (cf. Tamura 2000).

GB073,Are there morphological cases for independent oblique personal pronominal arguments (i.e. not S/A/P)?,"## Are there morphological cases for phonologically independent oblique personal pronouns (i.e. not S, A or P)?

## Summary

Are phonologically independent personal pronouns morphologically marked for oblique case (i.e. not [S, A or P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)))? Morphological case involves any type of case marking (or flagging) that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, etc.). Suppletion also counts as case marking for this feature. Oblique NPs are NPs having a function other than S, A or P, e.g. dative, locative, ablative, instrumental, comitative, location in time, etc. Note that genitive or possessive are not seen as cases for this feature.

## Procedure
1. Check the grammar's sections on pronouns, case/argument marking, adverbials and simple clauses.
2. Code 1 if oblique case is marked on pronouns using tone, affixation, suppletion, or any other type of bound marking.
3. Code 0 if oblique functions are only marked on pronouns using phonologically free adpositions.
4. Code 0 if oblique functions are only marked using constituent order.
5. Code ? if you think there is not enough data or analysis to say whether oblique case is marked on pronouns (e.g. because it is not clear whether the markers are phonologically bound, or nothing is mentioned by the author and there are no examples of oblique arguments). Mention this in the comment column.

## Examples

**Aneityum** (ISO 639-3: aty, Glottolog: anei1239)

In Aneityum, there are oblique prefixes for phonologically independent personal pronouns (Lynch 2000: 119-120). Aneityum is coded 1 for this feature.

```
Et       yip̃al        imta-ma             a    tata.
3SG.AOR  tell.story   DAT-1PL.POSS.EXCL   S    Dad
‘Dad told us a story.', lit. ‘Dad storytold to us.’ (Lynch 2000: 128)
```

**Ritarungo** (ISO 639-3: rit, Glottolog: rita1239)

In Ritarungo, different pronouns are used for different case functions, and the dative pronoun is the same as the genitive pronoun (Heath 1980: 44). Ritarungo is coded 1 for this feature.

 |             | Nominative | Dative     |
 | ----------- | ---------- |----------- |
 | 1SG         | _ra_         | _raku_       |

 | 1INCL.PL    | _lima_       | _limalaŋu_   |

**Abun** (ISO 639-3: kgr, Glottolog: abun1252)

In Abun, there are no morphological cases at all, not for pronominal noun phrases and not for non-pronominal noun phrases. It is coded 0 for this feature (Berry 1999: 48-49). Core argument functions are solely coded by means of word order, and non-core functions (such as the dative) feature a phonologically free preposition.

```
men    kadum    men     bi      tiket    is     ye-suk-mise
1PL    show     1PL     POSS    ticket   to     PERS-NOM-evil

## Summary

A preposition indicates the relationship of a noun phrase to the verb in a clause. This relationship could be circumstantial (e.g. locative, temporal, etc.) or a [core argument function (S, A or P)](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). A preposition precedes the noun phrase it occurs with. Proclitics with this function count as prepositions in Grambank. This means that [phonological boundness](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) is not relevant to this question. Circumpositions count both as prepositions and as postpositions. Inpositions (which occur somewhere in between words in a noun phrase) do not count as prepositions. Nouns that express the function of an adposition in a possessive construction (e.g. ***inside** of the car* to mean 'in the car') only count if they are visibly grammaticalized and no longer fully behave like nouns. If there is only one preposition, this is enough for a 1 here.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if the grammar mentions prepositions or prepositional proclitics in the language and there is no evidence (in examples) that the author's definition of preposition conflicts with the definition used in Grambank. If the prepositions are phonologically bound, mention this in the comment column.
2. Code 1 if you find examples of prepositions or prepositional proclitics in the language. If the prepositions are phonologically bound, mention this in the comment column.
3. Code 0 if a grammar mentions postpositions or postpositional enclitics, but no prepositions or postpositional proclitics.
4. Code 0 if a grammar mentions that there are no prepositions in the language.
5. Code 0 if a comprehensive grammar does not mention any prepositions in its sections on noun phrases, argument marking, adverbials, or adpositions.
6. Code ? if you suspect that the grammar may have missed that there are preposition in the language (e.g. because it is very short or does not have a comprehensive description of the noun phrase).

## Examples

**Yongbei Zhuang** (ISO 639-3: zyb, Glottolog: yong1276)

Yongbei Zhuang, coded as 1 (Luo 2008: 335–336): the term 'preposition' is used and examples are given. There is no indication that Luo's definition deviates from ours.

Examples of prepositions are *ʔdi⁶* ‘with’ (comitative), *ʔju⁵* ‘in’ (locative), *haɯ³* ‘to’ (dative):

```
ʔdi⁶ ʔaːu¹ ‘(talk) with uncle’
ʔju⁵ ʔbon⁵ ‘(sleep) in bed’
haɯ³ te¹   ‘(tell) to him’ (Luo 2008: 336)
```

**Shabo** (ISO 639-3: sbf, Glottolog: shab1252)

Shabo, coded as 0 (Kibebe 2015: 324). Kikebe mentions that there are only postpositions.

```
k̛on-e-m     ponti  heleti-ŋga
tree-DEF-M  on     bird-exist
‘There is a bird on the tree.’ (Kibebe 2015: 325)

‘Women/people are resting under the tree.’ (Kibebe 2015: 325)
```

**Bats** (ISO 639-3: bbl, Glottolog: bats1242)

Bats, coded as 0 (Holisky & Gagua 1994: 168-170): the authors give a number of examples of postpositions, but prepositions are not mentioned or found in the grammar.

```
t'iv-en     mak  Va

‘He is on the bridge.’ (Holisky & Gagua 1994: 168)

t'iv-en    k'ik'el  Jaix-n-as

‘I walked under the bridge’ (Holisky & Gagua 1994: 169)
```

**Ndam** (ISO 639-3: ndm, Glottolog: ndam1251)

Ndam is coded as ? (Broß 1988: 1–60). The language possibly has no adpositions. The locative is said to be formed with tone, but the description is not comprehensive enough and does not contain enough data to be certain that there are no adpositions. 

> Der Lokativ wird rein tonal gebildet. Die vorliegenden Belege haben in der Grundform 
entweder die Tonstruktur Mittel-Mittel, die sich im Lokativ zu Tief-Tief verändert. ...
oder Tief-Tief, die sich in Tief-Hoch wandelt. (The locative is formed purely by means of tone. The following examples have Mid-Mid tones as underlying melodies, which is changed into Low-Low in the locative. ... or Low-Low, which is changed into Low-High.) (Broß 1988: 58)

```
būgō  ‘house’        → bùgò  ‘in the house’
gūjʌ̄n ‘my stomach’   → gùjʌ̀n ‘in my stomach’
gə̀lè  ‘concession’   → gə̀lé  ‘in the concession’ (Broß 1988: 58)
```

**Panamint** (ISO 639-3: par, Glottolog: pana1305)

Panamint is a good example of a language with inpositions (cf. Dryer 2013), which is coded 0 here. Inpositions in Panamint come right after the noun, before other nominal modifiers, as is illustrated below for *tukkwantü* 'under', which comes in between a pronoun and an attributive numeral, and for *ma* 'from', which comes in between a noun and an adjective (Dayley 1989: 257).

```
Mümmi      tukkwantü  pahittünna.
you.all-O  under      three
‘It's under you three’ (Dayley 1989: 257)

Ohipim  ma   nati’iwantünna  tiyaitaiha  satü.

## Summary

A postposition indicates the relationship of a noun phrase to the verb in a clause. This relationship could be circumstantial (e.g. locative, temporal, etc.) or a [core argument function (S, A or P)](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). A postposition follows the noun phrase it occurs with. Enclitics with this function count as postpositions in Grambank. This means that [phonological boundness](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) is not relevant to this question. Circumpositions count as both postpositions and prepositions. Inpositions (which occur somewhere in between words in a noun phrase) do not count as postpositions. Nouns that express the function of an adposition in a possessive construction (e.g. ***inside** of the car* to mean 'in the car') only count if they are visibly grammaticalized and no longer fully behave like nouns. If there is only one postposition, this is enough for a 1 here.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if the grammar mentions free postpositions or postpositional enclitics in the language and there is no evidence (in examples) that the author's definition of 'postposition' conflicts with the one used in Grambank. If the postpositions are phonologically bound, mention this in the comment column.
2. Code 1 if you find examples of free postpositions or postpositional enclitics in the language. If the postpositions are phonologically bound, mention this in the comment column.
3. Code 0 if a grammar mentions free prepositions or prepositional proclitics, but no free postpositions or postpositional enclitics.
4. Code 0 if a grammar mentions that there are no postpositions in the language.
5. Code 0 if a comprehensive grammar does not mention any postpositions in its sections on noun phrases, argument marking, adverbials, or adpositions.
6. Code ? if you suspect that the grammar may have missed that there are postpositions in the language (e.g. because it is very short or does not have a comprehensive description of the noun phrase).

## Examples

**Lagwan** (ISO 639-3: kot, Glottolog: lagw1237)

Lagwan is coded 1 in Grambank. Lukas (1936: 56) attests two postpositions: temporal *ká* and *fa* 'except'. He gives only the following examples, from which it is impossible to check whether they are postpositions or suffixes, but as there is no evidence that Lukas' definition of postposition conflicts with ours elsewhere, this is not considered a problem.

```
fázàr         ká
early.morning TEMP
‘in the early morning’ Lukas (1936: 56)

méa    ɣo-ne      zumi-a-tan    šēn      kii   fa
people city-PROX  food-GEN-3PL  have.not fish  except
‘The people of this city have no food but fish.’ Lukas (1936: 56)

(my glosses; *ɣo-ne* is erroneously represented as *ro-ne* in the original example)
```

**Kwini** (ISO 639-3: gww, Glottolog: kwin1241)

In Kwini, case relations are marked with bound morphemes (in a morphosyntactic sense, but not in a phonological sense) that are at times attached to the end of the noun phrase, where they qualify as enclitics and thus postpositions, and at other times attached to the initial word of the noun phrase, where they qualify as inpositions (McGregor 1993: 36-41). Because they behave as postpositions at least in some cases, Kwini is coded 1 for the purpose of Grambank. The following is a list of postpositions found in Kwini, adopted from McGregor (1993: 36):

```
ngindalu   LOC(ative)
gu         DAT(ive)
yanga      ABL(ative)
we         PURP(osive)
nyine      INST(rumental)
gude       COM(itative)
nangga     GEN(itive)
```

**Siwi** (ISO 639-3: siz, Glottolog: siwi1239)

Souag (2010: 306) states that ""Siwi (...) is exclusively prepositional"", which is sufficient to code it 0.

**Baharna Arabic** (ISO 639-3: abv, Glottolog: baha1259)

In a sketch of Baharna Arabic, Holes (2006: 241–255) lists many prepositions but no postpositions. This is sufficient to assume an absence of postpositions in this language. Baharna Arabic is coded 0.

**Panamint** (ISO 639-3: par, Glottolog: pana1305)

Panamint is a good example of a language with inpositions (cf. Dryer 2013), which is coded 0 here. Inpositions in Panamint come right after the noun, before other nominal modifiers, as is illustrated below for *tukkwantü* 'under', which comes in between a pronoun and an attributive numeral, and for *ma* 'from', which comes in between a noun and an adjective (Dayley 1989: 257). These examples do not count as prepositions or postpositions in this survey.

```
Mümmi      tukkwantü  pahittünna.
you.all-O  under      three
‘It's under you three’ (Dayley 1989: 257)

Ohipim  ma   nati’iwantünna  tiyaitaiha  satü.

‘He died from a mean cold’ (Dayley 1989: 257)
```

Elsewhere, Panamint has postpositions which do trigger a 1 for this feature (Dayley 1989: 14).

## Summary

These [prefixes or proclitics](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) could have a variety of functions, marking TAME, functioning as verbal derivation markers, as inverse markers, relative markers, etc. Only [indexes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) dedicated to core argument marking do not count. The end result has to be a finite verb and cannot, for example, be a deverbal noun or an adverb. Grambank counts the separate elements of circumfixes as affixes. If one of the elements of a circumfix precedes the host it attaches to, we treat it as a prefix. If one of the elements of a circumfix follows the host it attaches to, we treat it as a suffix.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if the source mentions a phonologically bound prefix or proclitic on the verb which marks something other than [S, A or P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). 
2. Code 1 if there is no information on phonological (in)dependence but the prefix or proclitic is orthographically bound to the verb. Add a comment that your analysis is based on orthography here. 
3. Code 1 if you identify a phonologically bound prefix or proclitic in the examples/texts provided in a source.
4. Code 0 if the outcome of affixation is not a verb.
5. Code 0 if a source mentions that there are no prefixes or proclitics on the verb.
6. Code ? if there are examples that contain potential markers but their analysis remains inconclusive.

## Examples

**Pnar** (ISO 639-3: pbv, Glottolog: pnar1238)

Pnar only has prefixes according to Ring (2015: 72), who describes prefixes such as the durative marker *li-* but does not describe any relevant suffixes in the section on verbs (Ring 2015: 145–153). Pnar is coded 1 for this feature.

**Siamou** (ISO 639-3: sif, Glottolog: siam1242)

Siamou is one of many languages with a strong preference for suffixes. 

In its chapters on aspect, Toews (2015: 99–243) describes six suffixes. Nowhere does the author mention prefixes marking the categories we are interested in. It is coded 0 for this feature.

**Abkhaz** (ISO 639-3: abk, Glottolog: abkh1244)

Abkhaz (Chirikba 2003: 38–39) has both prefixes and suffixes. Non-volitional mood/modality, for example, is marked with a prefix on the verb, while iterative aspect is marked by a suffix. It is coded 1 for this feature.

## Summary
This feature targets the existence of [affixation](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) that is stem-internal, [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), and dedicated to one or more specific grammatical functions. If the only infixation process described for a language involves reduplication, please code 0 but be sure to note in the comments field that infixing reduplication is present. For the purposes of this feature tonal alternations are not considered to be a form of infixation, nor are 'vocalic melodies' as in Semitic languages; these phenomena should be disregarded in coding this feature. Note that the terms 'stem' and 'infix' may be used differently across some grammar writing traditions, so care must be taken to examine the structure of relevant forms rather than relying on the use of these terms. Here we are interested in infixes that occur internal to the base form of a verb that is held in common across inflected forms (called the 'stem' here), rather than affixes that occur between a verb's root or stem and some inflectional affix(es) or clitic(s).


## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is at least one productive, grammatically meaningful infix mentioned in the verbal domain. Such infixes may be used for derivational meanings as well as aspectual or voice-changing functions, so grammar sections that describe these functions should be examined for evidence of infixation.
2. Code 0 if infixing reduplication is described in verbs but no non-reduplicative infixes are mentioned. If you find evidence of infixing reduplication in verbs please leave a comment to note the presence of this reduplication pattern.
3. Code 0 if no infixes are mentioned, if only a small number of non-productive infixes are mentioned, or if the only evidence of infixation consists of fossilized forms.


## Examples

**Kashaya** (ISO 639-3: kju, Glottolog: kash1280)

In Kashaya a plural action meaning (e.g. an action performed multiple times on the same object, or an action performed on multiple objects) is expressed through a morpheme that has both suffix and infix allomorphs. One infix allomorph is -t-, which is infixed before a root-final consonant.

| Verb | Plural Action Form | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p<sup>h</sup>anem- | p<sup>h</sup>ane-t-m- | 'hit with the fist' |
| p<sup>h</sup>i&#577;ya:q- | p<sup>h</sup>iya-t-q- | 'recognize' |
| p<sup>h</sup>a'co:q<sup>w</sup>- | p<sup>h</sup>a'co:-t-q<sup>w</sup>- | 'stab' |

(Buckley 1997: 7) 

Kashaya would be coded 1.

**Indonesian** (ISO 639-3: ind, Glottolog: indo1316)

Some forms in Indonesian do appear to show what look like infixes with the forms -em-, -en-, and -er-. An example is *getar* 'to vibrate' : *g-em-etar* 'to tremble' (Sneddon 1996: 25). However, the relevant infix-like forms are not used productively, and occur only in a limited number of verbs. These infixation-like patterns probably reflect historical affixes that have become fossilized in a restricted number of contemporary forms. Indonesian is therefore coded 0.

**Tagalog** (ISO 639-3: tgl, Glottolog: taga1270)

Imperfective verb forms in Tagalog can be formed by the affixation of a form that may surface as the infix -in- or the prefix ni-, depending on morphophonological properties of the verb stem (Schacter and Otanes 1972: 363-366). Some verb stems are compatible with either the ni- or -in- form of this affix, as in the verb *lagyan* 'put in/on', which can be inflected for imperfective aspect as either *ni-lalagyan* or *l-in-alagyan* 'is/are putting on' (Schacter and Otanes 1972: 365).

An affix that *can* be infixed within a stem but also has prefix or suffix allomorphs is sufficient to trigger a 1 for this feature. The alternation with a prefix form ni- does not invalidate the existence of the infix variant of this Tagalog imperfective affix. Other verbal infixes exist in Tagalog, as well. Tagalog is coded 1.

**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

American English has been analyzed as having productive, genuine infixation in the -ma- form that Yu has dubbed ""Homeric infixation"" (2003: 120-150). This can occur in verbs, as in *edu-ma-cate* and *underesti-ma-mate*. However, this affixation pattern has no dedicated derivational or inflectional functions (and rather is used for the expressive purpose of generating a sense of pseudo-sophistication). Thus this infix fails to satisfy the criterion of having a dedicated grammatical function and English is coded 0.

GB082,Is there overt morphological marking of present tense on verbs?,"## Is there overt morphological marking of present tense on verbs?

## Summary
This question aims to capture productive paradigms of overt tense marking. 'Morphological marking on the verb' means that the marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verb. The marking of tense can involve affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims to capture overt marking of present tense on the verb. Lack of other marking is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example some grammarians state that present tense is expressed by a certain aspect on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing present tense then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB082) and the feature on tense auxiliaries ([GB121](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB121)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing present tense, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.

Sometimes a language is described as having a past/non-past distinction. In this case, if there is an overt marker of non-past code the language as 1 for this feature (GB082), but 0 for the feature on future tense [GB084](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB084). Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas present tense has less strict demands on the scope of its function. This situation is mirrored for future/non-future which results in a 1 for GB082 and GB084 but a 0 for GB083 (if both have over markers). It is however not acceptable for a present tense marker to occur in both future and past contexts.

If there is a tense system with a ""hodiernal"" category, i.e ""the day of speaking"", that also includes past events of the same day, this is permissible to code as a present tense marker.

## Procedure
1. Find the section discussing tense in the grammatical description.
2. If present tense is not explicitly defined, check the description of the other tenses (if there are any).
3. Code 1 if present tense can be marked on the verb by an affix or clitic, suppletion, tonal marking or reduplication.
4. Code 1 if present tense can be marked by a combination of morphology and an auxiliary or particle. In these cases, also code 1 for [GB121](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB121) on tense auxiliaries and/or [GB521](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB521) on tense particles.
4. If present tense is only marked by the absence of other markers, code 0.
5. If the language is described as having a non-past tense and it is overtly marked, code it as 1 for this feature (GB082), but as 0 for the feature on future tense marking [GB084](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB084). (Granted that marking is morphological, not with a free-standing marker.)

## Examples
**Swedish** (ISO 639-3: swe, Glottolog: swed1254)

Swedish has a present tense marker *-r* (Skirgård p.c. 2020), as the table below shows. Swedish is coded as 1 for this feature.

| | present | past | infinitive |
|-------- | ---- | ----------- |-- |
| wash dishes | _diska-r_ | _diska-de_ |_diska_| 
| swim | _simma-r_ | _simma-de_ | _simma_ |

GB083,Is there overt morphological marking on the verb dedicated to past tense?,"## Is there overt morphological marking on the verb dedicated to past tense?

## Summary
This question aims to capture [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) paradigms of overt tense marking. ‘Morphological marking on the verb’ means that the marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verb. The marking of tense can involve affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims to capture overt marking of past tense on the verb. Lack of other marking is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example some grammarians state that past tense is expressed by a certain aspect on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expression past tense then this construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB083) and the feature on tense auxiliaries ([GB121](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB121)). If the marking of past tense is accomplished by more than one marker and at least one is bound, code 1. If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing past tense, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.

The past tense marker should be dedicated to past tense and not also mark perfective aspect, present, or future. A non-future marker is not enough for a 1 here.

## Procedure
1. Find the section discussing tense in the grammatical description.
2. If past tense is not explicitly defined, check the descriptions of the other tenses and moods (if there are any).
3. Code 1 if past tense can be marked on the verb by an affix or clitic, suppletion, tonal marking or reduplication.
4. Code 1 if past tense can be marked by a combination of morphology and an auxiliary or particle. In these cases, also code 1 for [GB121](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB121) on tense auxiliaries and/or [GB521](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB521) on tense particles.
5. If past tense is only marked by the absence of other markers, code 0.

## Examples
**Swedish** (ISO 639-3: swe, Glottolog: swed1254)

Swedish has a past tense marker _-de/e_ (c.f. Teleman et al. 1999), illustrated with the table below. For some stems not illustrated here, there is also vowel alternation for tense, as is common in other Germanic languages. Swedish is coded as a 1 for this feature.

| | present | past | infinitive |
|-------- | ---- | ----------- |-- |
| ‘wash dishes’ | _diska-r_ | _diska-de_ |_diska_| 
| ‘swim’ | _simma-r_ | _simma-de_ | _simma_ |
| ‘dance’ | _dansa-r_ | _dansa-de_ | _dansa_ |
| ‘fly’ | _flyge-r_ | _fl**ö**g_ | _fl**y**ga_ |

## Summary
This question aims to capture [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) paradigms of overt tense marking. 'Morphological marking on the verb' means that the marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verb. The marking of tense can involve affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims to capture overt marking of future tense on the verb. Lack of other marking is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and an auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that future tense is expressed by a certain marker on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing future tense then this construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB084) and the feature on tense auxiliaries ([GB121](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB121)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing future tense, only consider the marking that is obligatory.

Sometimes a language will be described as having a past/non-past distinction. In this case, if there is an overt marker of non-past code the language as 1 for the feature on present tense ([GB082](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB082)), but 0 for this feature (GB084). Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas present tense has less strict demands on the scope of its function.

It can be hard to distinguish future tense from different modal categories, after all if something is in the future it has not yet occurred and can be construed as something wished for, planned, intended, etc. For this reason, it is necessary to pay particular attention to sections on mood, especially irrealis, when coding for future tense.

If a language only has future tense under negation, this does not count for this feature. It needs to be present for affirmation as well. The reason for this is that conditions such as 'only under negation' are likely to give rise to quite different analysis by different linguists (hence it is hard to ensure comparability) and might also be overlooked. If we were to treat such marginal cases as triggering 1 we would most likely have to go back to a lot of the cases that were coded as 0 and re-evaluate their coding more thoroughly.

## Procedure

1. Find the section discussing tense in the grammatical description.
2. If future tense is not explicitly defined, check the description of the other tenses and moods (if there are any).
3. Code 1 if future tense can be marked on the verb by an affix or clitic, suppletion, tonal marking or reduplication.
4. Code 1 if future tense can be marked by a combination of morphology and an auxiliary or particle. In these cases, also code 1 for [GB121](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB121) on tense auxiliaries and/or [GB521](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB521) on tense particles.
4. If future tense is only marked by the absence of other markers, code 0.
5. If the language is described as having a non-past tense and it is overtly marked, code it as 0 for this feature (GB084) but as 1 for [GB082](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB082). 

## Examples

**Acholi** (ISO 639-3: ach, Glottolog: acol1236)

In Acholi, future tense is marked by an infix _bí_ which derives from the verb 'to come' _bino_. Acholi is coded as 1 for this feature. Malandra (1952: 78–79) gives the following examples:

| past | present | future |
| ---- | ----------- |-- |
| _àyecò_ I tore | _àyécò_ I tear |_ábíyecò_ I will (shall) tear| 
| _àkayò_ I reaped | _àkáyò_ I reap |_àbíkayò_ I will (shall) reap|

GB086,Is a morphological distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect available on verbs?,"## Is a morphological distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect available on verbs?

## Summary
This feature is concerned with [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) marking of imperfective and perfective grammatical aspects. These categories could go by the name of punctual and continuous, preterit and progressive, etc. The answer could be 1 even if only one of these is overtly marked, e.g. if the imperfective is marked by an affix and the perfective is marked by an auxiliary. 

There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that the imperfective aspect is expressed by a certain form on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing imperfective aspect then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB086) and the feature on aspectual auxiliaries ([GB120](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB120) and/or [GB520](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB520)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing imperfective aspect, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.

Please take notice that this feature (GB086) and the features on aspectual auxiliaries [GB120](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB120) and particles [GB520](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB520) do not cover exactly the same functions. The features on auxiliaries and particles cover more grammatical aspects than just perfective and imperfective. 

If this distinction is only available in some TAM-conditions, this counts as well. For example, if there is no aspectual distinction in the past but it only exists in the present, this still triggers a 1.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if perfective or imperfective aspect can be marked on the verb by an affix or clitic, suppletion, tonal marking or reduplication.
2. If only perfective aspect or only imperfective aspect is overly marked, code 1.
3. If there is no marking of aspect at all, code 0.
4. If it is not possible to tease apart present tense and imperfective, and that is the only possible relevant construction in the language for this feature, code as ?.

## Examples
**Chukchii** (ISO 639-3: ckt, Glottolog: chuk1273)

In Chukchi, there is aspectual marking on the verb that distinguishes progressive aspect from a neutral aspect. The suffix differs between men's and women's language (_-rkə_ / _-ccə_) and varies somewhat with phonological context. Dunn (1999: 176) gives the following examples. Chukchi is coded as 1 for this feature.

||non-future | future | 
|-------- | ---- | ----------- |
Neutral aspect | _jetɣʔi_  ‘She came.’ | _re-jetɣʔe_  ‘She will come.’ |
Progressive aspect (men) | *jetə-**rkə**-n* ‘She is coming.’ | *re-jetə-**rkə**-n* ‘She will be coming.’ |
Progressive aspect (women) | *jetə-**ccə**-n* ‘She is coming.’ | *re-jetə-**ccə**-n* ‘She will be coming.’ |

GB089,Can the S argument be indexed by a suffix/enclitic on the verb in the simple main clause?,"## Can the S argument be indexed by a suffix/enclitic on the verb in the simple independent clause?


## Summary
Is there a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) [S argument](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) [index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) that follows its verbal host (i.e. attaches to it as a [suffix or an enclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics))?

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with verbal morphology, specifically the subsections on (pronominal) agreement or argument cross-referencing.
2. Code 1 if there is a phonologically bound element that indexes the S argument on the verb or auxiliary. The index needs to follow the verbal host it is bound to.
3. If there is some variation in the position of the S index conditioned by the verb (e.g. most verbs code the S argument with a suffix, but a couple use a prefix, this might be the case in the so-called split-S/stative-active languages), consider only the patterns which occur with large classes of verbs.
4. If the verb shows overt indexing only with some arguments (e.g. only with animate arguments or only with first person singular arguments, the situation known as differential argument indexing), this still counts as 1.
5. If the S argument is indexed but not by a suffix or enclitic, code 0.
6. If there is no indexing of the S argument, code 0.
7. If only a small set of verbs (fewer than a dozen) indexes S arguments, code 0.
8. Ignore all other ways of indexing arguments (e.g. via a stem alternation, stress or tone), they are not covered by any of the Grambank features.

## Examples

**Korowai** (ISO 639-3: khe, Glottolog: koro1312)

Independent verb forms express status, subject (S and A) person-number, mood, and aspect. They are used in independent (final) clauses, subordinate clauses, and chained (medial) clauses (de Vries & van Enk 1997: 87-90, 183). Dependent verb forms do not express S/A person and number. Code as 1 (the fact that there are zero morphemes and syncretism of second and third person does not matter).

The person-number suffixes in the realis are as follows:

* 1SG _-le_/_-nde_
* 1PL _-le_/_-te_/_-nde_
* 2/3SG zero/_-l_
* 2/3PL _-te(l)_

This same set is used with small variations for the other statuses, moods, and aspects. Intentional and imperative mood take an entirely different set of person-number endings, distinguishing second from third person in both singular and plural. The 'zero' ending (stem-only form) is the usual non-1SG realis form.

```
ye   khén-telo-do          yakhatimekho
he   angry-be.3SG.REAL-DS  renounce.3SG.REAL
‘He went angry and she renounced.’ (de Vries & van Enk 1997: 183)
```

**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

The verb shows overt indexing with S arguments via suffixes with third person singular arguments in present, as in _he sleep-s_ vs. _we sleep_. English is coded as 1.

**Bukiyip** (ISO 639-3: ape, Glottolog: buki1249)

Argument indexes (person-number-gender) vary depending on the verb class (see Conrad & Wogiga 1991: 25–33). There are two intransitive classes:

- Class 5 (intr., relatively large in number): SBJ-V-(BEN/DIR)
- Class 6 (intr., small number of stative verbs): V-OBJ

For coding we consider only the major pattern (here Class 5 with prefixes, as in (a)). Class 6 with S suffixes from the object suffixes paradigm, as in (b), is a minor pattern limited to a small set of verbs and should be ignored. Bukiyip is thus coded as 0.

```
a. Major pattern:
   Ny-é-nak-moli         malmu?
   2SG.SBJ-REAL-go-come  why
   ‘Why did you come?’ (Conrad & Wogiga 1991: 42)

b. Minor pattern:
   éblany-iwe.
   be.ashamed-1SG.OBJ
   ‘I am ashamed’ (Conrad & Wogiga 1991: 31)
```

**Cashinahua** (ISO 639-3: cbs, Glottolog: cash1254)

There is no person indexing in Cashinahua. The verb indexes only the number of the subject (S and A), whereby the singular is zero marked. Moreover, there is no indexing on the verb if the subject is the 1PL or 2PL pronoun (Camargo 2007: 1876). Code as 1.

```
a. kaman-an baka  ʂau  pi-mis-bu.
   dog-ERG  fish  bone eat-HAB-PL
   ‘The dogs eat fish bones.’ (Camargo 2007: 1877)

b. paku-n    nam-ɨ-Ø   pi-mis.
   Paku-ERG  meat-OBJ  eat-HAB
   ‘Paco always eats meat.’ (Camargo 2007: 1873)

c. ɨa, ɨn  daja-mis-ki.
   me  I   work-HAB-ASS
   ‘As for me, I work.’ (Camargo 2007: 1875)

d. nun tsaka-mis-ki.
   we hunt-HAB-ASS
   ‘we always hunt.’ (Montag 2005: 6)
```

**Makasae-Makalero** (ISO 639-3: mkz, Glottolog: maka1316)

In Makasae-Makalero most verbs do not index core arguments, as in (a)-(d). 
A set of five verbs index the number of S and A arguments via suppletive stem allomorphs (Huber 2011: 130). This set is not sufficient for coding as 1: it is a small set of verbs and the respective indexes are not suffixes. Makasae-Makalero is coded as 0. 

```
a. Ani hai  mu’a-li’an. 
   1s  NSIT ground-fall
   ‘I already fell down.’ (Huber 2011: 146)

b. Ani  ei  pase.
   1SG  2SG beat
   ‘I beat you.’ (Huber 2011: 218)

c. Ei  ani pase.
   2SG 1SG beat
   ‘You beat me.’ (Huber 2011: 218)

d. Ina-uai	ni-mata	     uaro
   mother-HON	REFL-child   wash
   ‘The mother is washing her child’ (Huber 2011: 391)

(Abbreviations: NSIT new situation)
```

**Sochiapam Chinantec** (ISO 639-3: cso, Glottolog: soch1239)

In Sochiapam Chinantec S arguments are indexed via tone and stress alternations, not by a suffix/enclitic (Foris 2000: 83–182). Sochiapam Chinantec is coded as 0.

```
‘run’
        1sg         1pl        2          3
PRS     cuon²       cuóun²³    cuounh³²   cuon²

1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with verbal morphology, specifically the sections on (pronominal) agreement or argument cross-referencing.
2. Code 1 if there is a phonologically bound element that indexes the S argument on the verb or auxiliary. The index needs to precede the verbal host it is bound to.
3. If there is some variation in the position of the S index conditioned by the verb (e.g. most verbs code the S argument with a suffix, but a couple use a prefix, this might be the case in the so-called split-S/stative-active languages), consider only the patterns which occur with large classes of verbs.
4. If the verb shows overt indexing only with some arguments (e.g. only with animate arguments or only with first person singular arguments, the situation known as differential argument indexing), this still counts as 1.
5. If the S argument is indexed but not by a prefix or proclitic, code 0.
6. If there is no indexing of the S argument, code 0.
7. If only a small set of verbs (fewer than a dozen) indexes S arguments, code 0.
8. Ignore all other ways of indexing arguments (e.g. via a stem alternation, stress or tone), they are not covered by any of the Grambank features.

## Examples
**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

The verb shows overt indexing with S arguments via suffixes with third person singular arguments in present, as in _he sleep-s_ vs. _we sleep_. There is no indexing by prefixes. English is coded as 0.

**Sochiapam Chinantec** (ISO 639-3: cso, Glottolog: soch1239)

In Sochiapam Chinantec S arguments are indexed via tone and stress alternations, not by a prefix/proclitic (Foris 2000: 83–182). Sochiapam Chinantec is coded as 0.

```
‘run’

PRS     cuon²       cuóun²³    cuounh³²   cuon²
(Foris 2000: 149)
```

**Bukiyip** (ISO 639-3: ape, Glottolog: buki1249)

Argument indexes (person-number-gender) vary depending on the verb class (see Conrad and Wogiga 1991: 25–33). There are two intransitive classes:

- Class 5 (intransitive, relatively large in number): SBJ-V-(BEN/DIR)
- Class 6 (intransitive, small number of stative verbs): V-OBJ

For coding one considers only the major pattern (here Class 5 with prefixes). Thus, Bukiyip is coded as 1.

```
Ny-é-nak-moli         malmu?
2SG.SBJ-REAL-go-come  why
‘Why did you come?’ (Conrad & Wogiga 1991: 42)
```

**Makasae-Makalero** (ISO 639-3: mkz, Glottolog: maka1316)

In Makasae-Makalero most verbs do not index core arguments, as in (a)-(d). 
A set of five verbs index the number of S and A arguments via suppletive stem allomorphs (Huber 2011: 130). This set is not sufficient for coding as 1: it is a small set of verbs and the respective indexes are not prefixes. Makasae-Makalero is coded as 0. 

```

## Summary
Is there a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) [A argument](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) [index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) that follows its verbal host (i.e. attaches to it as a [suffix or an enclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics))?

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with verbal morphology, specifically the subsections on (pronominal) agreement or argument cross-referencing.
2. Code 1 if there is a phonologically bound element that indexes the A argument on the verb or auxiliary. The index needs to follow the verbal host it is bound to.
3. If there is some variation in the position of the A index conditioned by the verb (e.g. most verbs code the A argument with a suffix, but a couple use a prefix), consider only the patterns which occur with large classes of verbs.
4. If the verb shows overt indexing only with some arguments (e.g. only with animate arguments or only with first person singular arguments, the situation known as differential argument indexing), this still counts as 1.
5. If the A argument is indexed but not by a suffix or enclitic, code 0.
6. If there is no indexing of the A argument, code 0.
7. If only a small set of verbs (fewer than a dozen) indexes A arguments, code 0.
8. Ignore all other ways of indexing arguments (e.g. via a stem alternation, stress or tone), they are not covered by any of the Grambank features.

## Examples
**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

The verb shows overt indexing only with third person singular arguments in present, as in _he eat-s_ vs. _we eat_. The suffix attaches to all verbs. This is sufficient to code English as 1.

**Korowai** (ISO 639-3: khe, Glottolog: koro1312)

Independent verb forms express status, subject person-number, mood, and aspect. They are used in independent (final) clauses, subordinate clauses, and chained (medial) clauses. Dependent verb forms do not express subject person and number. Code as 1 (the fact that there are zero morphemes and syncretism of second and third person do no matter). See de Vries & van Enk (1997: 87-90, 183).

The person-number suffixes in the realis are as follows:
* 1SG _-le_/_-nde_
* 1PL _-le_/_-te_/_-nde_
* 2/3SG zero/_-l_
* 2/3PL _-te(l)_

This same set is used with small variations for the other statuses, moods, and aspects. Intentional and imperative mood take an entirely different set of person-number suffixes, distinguishing second from third person in both singular and plural. The zero form (stem-only form) is the usual non-1SG realis form.

```
nu	maun	mi-p
I	water	drink-1SG.INTEN
‘I want to drink water.’ (van Enk & de Vries 1997: 67)
```

**Cashinahua** (ISO 639-3: cbs, Glottolog: cash1254)

There is no person indexing in Cashinahua. The verb indexes only the number of the subject (S/A), agreement in the singular being zero marked. Moreover, there is no indexing on the verb if the subject is the 1PL or 2PL pronoun (Camargo 2007: 1876). Code as 1.

```
a. kaman-an baka  ʂau  pi-mis-bu.
   dog-ERG  fish  bone eat-HAB-PL
   ‘The dogs eat fish bones.’ (Camargo 2007: 1877)

b. paku-n    nam-ɨ-Ø   pi-mis.
   Paku-ERG  meat-OBJ  eat-HAB
   ‘Paco always eats meat.’ (Camargo 2007: 1873)

c. ɨa, ɨn  daja-mis-ki.
   me  I   work-HAB-ASS
   ‘As for me, I work.’ (Camargo 2007: 1875)

d. nun tsaka-mis-ki.
   we hunt-HAB-ASS
   ‘We always hunt.’ (Montag 2005: 6)
```

**Bukiyip** (ISO 639-3: ape, Glottolog: buki1249)

Code as 0 (see Conrad & Wogiga 1991: 25–33).

The verb in Bukiyip indexes S, A, and P arguments. The A argument is always expressed as a prefix.

```
Monoken  da         wo   ny-ú-klipw-e              ye?
why      therefore  NEG  2SG.SBJ-IRR-tell-1SG.OBJ  NEG
‘Why didn't you tell me?’ (Conrad & Wogiga 1991: 42)
```

**Makasae-Makalero** (ISO 639-3: mkz, Glottolog: maka1316)

In Makasae-Makalero most verbs do not index core arguments, as in (a)-(d). 
A set of five verbs index the number of S and A arguments via suppletive stem allomorphs (Huber 2011: 130). This set is not sufficient for coding as 1: it is a small set of verbs and the respective indexes are not suffixes. Makasae-Makalero is coded as 0. 

```

## Summary

## Examples

**Bukiyip** (ISO 639-3: ape, Glottolog: buki1249) 

The verb in Bukiyip indexes S, A, and P arguments. The position of indexes varies depending on the verb class (Conrad and Wogiga 1991: 25–33). The following transitive classes are distinguished:
* Class 1 (transitive, small in number): SBJ-OBJ-V
* Class 2 (transitive, large in number): SBJ-V-OBJ
* Class 3 (transitive, large in number): SBJ-(OBJ)-V
* Class 4 (transitive, relatively large in number): SBJ-V-(OBJ)
* Class 7 (transitive, one verb, obligatory subject NP): SBJ-V-(OBJ)

It is impossible to identify one major position of P indexes, as both class 2 and 4 (suffixes), as well as class 3 (prefixes) are large in number, so code as 1 for both GB093 and [GB094](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB094).

**Korowai** (ISO 639-3: khe, Glottolog: koro1312)

Independent verb forms index subject (S and A) person-number, status, mood, and aspect. They are used in independent (final) clauses, subordinate clauses, and chained (medial) clauses. Code as 0 as there is no indexing of the P argument on the verb (see de Vries & van Enk 1997: 87–90, 183).

**Bukiyip** (ISO 639-3: ape, Glottolog: buki1249) 

The verb in Bukiyip indexes S, A, and P arguments. The position of the argument person-number-gender indexes varies depending on the verb class (Conrad & Wogiga 1991: 25–33). The following transitive classes are distinguished:
* Class 1 (transitive, small in number): SBJ-OBJ-V
* Class 2 (transitive, large in number): SBJ-V-OBJ
* Class 3 (transitive, large in number): SBJ-(OBJ)-V
* Class 4 (transitive, relatively large in number): SBJ-V-(OBJ)
* Class 7 (transitive, one verb, obligatory subject NP): SBJ-V-(OBJ)

It is impossible to identify one major position of P indexes, as both class 2 and 4 (suffixes), as well as class 3 (prefixes) are large in number, so code as 1 for both [GB093](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB093) and GB094.

‘He ate (coconuts).’ (Conrad & Wogiga 1991: 27)
```

**Korowai** (ISO 639-3: khe, Glottolog: koro1312)

Independent verb forms index subject (S and A) person-number, status, mood, and aspect. They are used in independent (final) clauses, subordinate clauses, and chained (medial) clauses. Code as 0 as there is no indexing of the P argument on the verb (see de Vries & van Enk 1997: 87–90, 183).

```

## Summary

Marking strategies of core participants include both marking by [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) and by flagging (i.e. case or adposition marking). Variations in marking strategies include both variations in the alignment patterns and variations in position (e.g. suffixing vs. prefixing) in case of indexes. This question includes some of the cases referred to as (alignment) split in the literature. 
Merely different allomorphs of person/number indexes in the same position do not count. 
Polarity (i.e. positive vs. negative distinction) does not count as a TAM category. 
Any variation of indexing in the imperative does not count either.

## Procedure
1. Consider the flagging of the [core arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) in the language (coded in [GB408](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB408), [GB409](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB409), and [GB410](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB410)). Is there any variation in the flagging of either S, A, or P which is determined by TAM categories (e.g. certain cases are used only in the perfective but not in the imperfective)? Code 1 if this is the case. Specifically look for such terms as *split ergative/ergativity* and *differential subject marking*.
2. Consider the indexing patterns of the language (coded in [GB089](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB089)–[GB094](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB409)). Is there any variation in the indexing of either S, A, or P which is determined by TAM categories? Code 1 for any difference in the form of the respective markers if this result in different alignment patterns. Also code 1 for variation in the position of indexes (prefix/proclitic vs. suffix/clitic), even if the overall alignment pattern remains the same.
3. Code 0 if there is no variation in indexing or flagging according to TAM distinctions.
4. Code 0 if TAM marking results in merely different allomorphs of person/number indexes in the same position, so that both the overall alignment pattern and the position of markers remain the same. For the purposes of this question, the alternation between zero and overt indexes in some TAM contexts does not count (code as 0).


## Examples

**Itzá** (ISO 639-3: itz, Glottolog: itza1241)

A transitive verb indexes the A argument by means of the so-called ‘Set A’ **prefixes**, e.g. *inw-* ‘1SG.A’ in (a) and (b). P arguments are indexed by means of the ‘Set B’ **suffixes**, e.g. *-ech* ‘2SG.P’ in the same example (Hofling 2000: 357).

```
Aspect: incompletive

k-inw-il-ik-ech.
INCMPL-1SG.A-see-INCMPL.TR-2SG.P
‘I see you.’

Aspect: completive

t-inw-il-ik-ech.
COMPL-1SG.A-see-COMPL.TR-2SG.P
‘I saw you.’
```

With intransitive verbs both Set A and Set B affixes can occur. In this case the distribution is conditioned by the aspect of the clause (called ‘status’ in Mayan linguistics). The set A person markers are used in the non-completive aspect, e.g. *inw-* ‘1SG.A’ in (c), whereas the B markers are used in the completive aspect, e.g. *-ech* ‘2SG.P’ in (d). Itzá is coded 1.

```
Aspect: incompletive

k-inw-em-el.
INCMPL-1SG.A-descend-INCMPL.INTR
‘I descend.’

Aspect: completive

em-Ø-ech.
descend-COMPL.INTR-2SG.P 
‘You descended.’
```

**Georgian** (ISO 639-3: kat, Glottolog: nucl1302)

In Series I (Present) the A argument is in the nominative case, e.g. *deda* ‘mother.NOM’ in (a), whereas the P argument is marked with the dative case, e.g. *tavis švil-s* ‘self.GEN child-DAT’ in (a). 
In Series II (Aorist) the A argument is in the narrative case (or ergative), e.g. *deda-m* ‘mother-NARR’ in (b). The P argument is in the nominative case, e.g *tavis-i švil-i* ‘self.GEN-NOM child-NOM’ in (b), see Harris (1981: 27). Georgian is coded 1.

```
Series I (Present)

a. deda       bans             tavis    švil-s.
   mother.NOM she.bathes.him.I self.GEN child-DAT
   ‘The mother is bathing her child.’
   
Series II (Aorist)

b. deda-m       dabana             tavis-i       švil-i.
   mother-NARR  she.bathed.him.II  self.GEN-NOM  child-NOM
   ‘The mother bathed her child.’
```

## Summary

Marking strategies include both marking by [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) and by flagging. The distinction between intransitive and transitive verbs is not included here. 
Variations in marking strategies include both variations in the alignment patterns and variations in position (e.g. suffixing vs. prefixing) in case of indexes. 
Mere differences in forms of the indexes triggered by various conjugation classes are not sufficient for 1. 
For a language to be coded 1 the respective verb classes need to be of a substantial size (several dozen verbs or more) and ideally represent a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) pattern. 
The presence of small verb classes whose members are often exhaustively listed in a descriptive grammar and are presented as exceptional patterns does not qualify as 1.
The patterns of interest are more common with intransitive verbs and include cases of the so-called active-inactive alignment (or simply: active, agentive-patientive or stative-active) in cases of differentially marked [S arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). Some grammars use the terms unergative-unaccusative verbs. The pattern of interest is, however, not restricted to the S argument. Variations in marking of [A and P arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) are also included.


## Procedure

1. Consider the flagging patterns of the language (coded in [GB408](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB408), [GB409](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB409), and [GB410](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB410)). Identify whether there is any variation in the flagging of either [S, A, or P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) that is determined by verb classes.
2. If there is variation in flagging, consider whether the respective verb classes are of substantial size. If the classes are substantially large, code 1 in the following cases: Code 1 if there are differences in the form of the respective markers which result in different alignment patterns. Code 1 if there is a variation in the position of indexes (prefix/proclitic vs. suffix/clitic), even if the overall alignment pattern remains the same.
3. Consider the indexing patterns of the language (coded in [GB089](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB089)–[GB094](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB409), and [GB410](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB094)). Consider whether there are any differences in the form of the respective indexes. Specifically look for such terms as *active(-inactive)*, *agentive-patientive*, *stative-active alignment* or *split-S* and consider the respective verb classes. Look for cases of *non-canonical argument marking* and consider the respective verb classes.
4. If there is variation in indexing, consider whether the differences in indexing result in different alignment patterns or whether there is a variation in the position of indexes (prefix/proclitic vs. suffix/clitic). If the answer to either of these questions is positive, consider whether the respective verb classes are of substantial size. If the classes are substantially large, code 1.
5. Ignore mere variations in the phonological form of indexes conditioned by various [conjugation classes](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB111). 
6. Ignore the relatively common situation where some verb classes do not allow any indexing. This is not sufficient for 1.

## Examples

**Maca** (ISO 639-3: wpc, Glottolog: maco1239)

Mako verb roots can be divided into two classes depending on the _phonology_ of the verb: roots ending in a consonant (Class I) and roots ending in a vowel (Class II) (see Rosés Labrada 2015: 294, 297).

Class I: _ed-_ ‘see’, _otid-_ ‘work’, _pʰõɾ-_ ‘put away’, _kɨkɨd-_ ‘dry in the sun’, _amat-_ ‘squeeze’

Class II: _hã-_ ‘make/do’, _di-_ ‘scrape’, _wahi-_ ‘not know’, _wi-_ fell’, _wo-_ ‘stink/smell’

Class I verbs attach the subject (S/A) indexes in a suffix slot immediately following the verb root, as in (a). 
Class II verbs attach the subject indexes (S/A) in a prefix slot immediately preceding the verb root, as in (b). 
Maca is coded as 1.

```
a. Class I:
   me-t-obe
   fall-1SG-TAM
   ‘I fall.’ (Rosés Labrada 2015: 296)

b. Class II:
   ʧɨ̃-hãmat-obe
   1SG-stand.up-TAM 
   ‘I stand up.’ (Rosés Labrada 2015: 295)
```

**Basque** (ISO 639-3: eus, Glottolog: basq1248)

Monovalent predicates in Basque are divided into two groups (see Hualde & de Urbana 2003). The so-called unergative predicates mark the S argument with ergative case, as in (a). The so-called unaccusative predicates mark the S argument with the absolutive case, as in (b).

The class of unergative verbs contains quite a few simple verbs, such as *dirdiratu* ‘glimmer’, *botatu* ‘bounce’, *bozkatu* ‘vote’, *gogoetatu* ‘meditate’, *irakin* ‘boil’, *iraun* ‘persist’, *bazkaldu* ‘have dinner’, *afaldu* ‘have supper’, and *dimititu* ‘resign’ (Hualde & de Urbana 2003: 388–389). Moreover, there is a large class of unergative [complex predicates (or light verb constructions)](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB123), which are monovalent, they are composed of a bare noun and a verb indicating action: *egin* ‘do’, as in (c). Basque is coded as 1.

```
a. Jon-ek  saltatu  du. (unergative)
   Jon-ERG jump     AUX
   ‘Jon jumped.’ (Hualde & de Urbana 2003: 364)

b. Jon     etorri da. (unaccusative)
   Jon.ABS come   AUX
   ‘Jon came.’ (Hualde & de Urbana 2003: 364)

c. Jon-ek   korri    egin   du. (unergative complex predicate)
   Jon-ERG  run      do     AUX
   ‘Jon ran.’ (Hualde & de Urbana 2003: 390)
```

**German** (ISO 639-3: deu, Glottolog: stan1295)

German has about a dozen verbs that take the patient-like argument in the dative case (Witzlack-Makarevich p.c. 2020). They include *danken* ‘thank’, *folgen* ‘follow’, and *verzeihen* ‘pardon, forgive’. German is coded 0 because this verb class does not qualify as substantially large. Many other languages (if not every language) have small classes of predicates with marking patterns deviating from the one major pattern.

``` 
a. Ich danke dir.
   I   thank you.DAT
   ‘I thank you.’

b. Bitte  folgen Sie mir!
   please follow you me.DAT
   ‘Please, follow me!’

c. Ich  kann  ihm      nicht  verzeihen.
   I    can   him.DAT  NEG    forgive
   ‘I cannot forgive him.’
``` 

**Osage** (ISO 639-3: osa, Glottolog: osag1243)

Osage transitive verbs index both A and P arguments, as in (a) (see Pustet 2002).
Around 70% of intransitive verbs use the same indexes to mark the S argument as the ones used for the A argument, as in (b), whereas the remaining 30% of intransitive verbs (still a substantial amount) use the indexes identical to the ones used for the P arguments. There seems to be a semantic basis for the formal contrast between the indexing patterns with A and P prefixes. This semantic distinction is described in terms of the notion of agency: i.e. 'active' intransitive verbs use A indexes and 'non-active' intransitive verbs use P indexes. Osage is coded as 1.

```
a. ǫ-tha-nǫk̩ˀǫ
   1SG.P-2SG.A-hear
   ‘You hear/heard me.’ (Wolff 1952: 234, as in Pustet 2002: 391)

b. tha-k̩ˀǫ'çagi (and other active verbs) 
   2SG.A-very.fast
   ‘You are very fast.’ (La Flesche 1932: 88, as in Pustet 2002: 391)    
  
c. ǫ-shį'
   1SG.P-fat
   ‘I am fat.’ (La Flesche 1932: 131, as in Pustet 2002: 391)
```

**Makasae-Makalero** (ISO 639-3: mkz, Glottolog: maka1316)

In Makasae-Makalero the core arguments are not flagged. This is true for both pronominal (a-c) and nominal (d) arguments. Thus, there is no variation in flagging of core participants based on verb classes. Furthermore, most Makasae-Makalero verbs do not index core arguments, as in (a)-(d). 
A set of five verbs index the number of S and A arguments via suppletive stem allomorphs (Huber 2011: 130). This set is not sufficient for coding as 1. Furthermore, a small group of verbs overtly index a referential third person P argument with the prefix _k-_ (Huber 2011: 349-350). This set is not sufficient for coding as 1. Makasae-Makalero is coded as 0. 

```
a. Ani hai  mu’a-li’an. 
   1SG NSIT ground-fall
   ‘I already fell down.’ (Huber 2011: 146)

b. Ani  ei  pase.
   1SG  2SG beat
   ‘I beat you.’ (Huber 2011: 218)

c. Ei  ani pase.
   2SG 1SG beat
   ‘You beat me.’ (Huber 2011: 218)

d. Ina-uai	ni-mata	     uaro
   mother-HON	REFL-child   wash
   ‘The mother is washing her child.’ (Huber 2011: 391)
(Abbreviations: NSIT new situation)
```

## Summary
Marking strategies of core participants include both marking by [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) and by flagging (i.e. case or adposition marking). Variations in marking strategies include both variations in the alignment patterns and variations in position (e.g. suffixing vs. prefixing) in case of indexes. Mere differences in forms of the indexes triggered by various conjugation classes are not sufficient for a 1. This question includes cases referred to as person-based (alignment) split and hierarchical alignment in the literature. 

## Procedure
1. Consider whether there is any variation in the form of the argument indexes on the verb (coded in [GB089](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB089)–[GB094](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB094)) related to the person of arguments (first vs. second vs. third).
2. If there is some variation, code 1 if this results in different alignment patterns. 
3. Code 1 if the position of indexes differs (prefix/proclitic vs. suffix/clitic), even if the overall alignment pattern remains the same.
4. The alternation between zero marking indexing for some persons and overt indexing for other persons does not suffice for 1.
5. Consider flagging. Code 1 if case/adposition marking of S, A, or P arguments (coded in [GB408](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB408), [GB409](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB409), and [GB410](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB410)) varies according to the person of the marked argument.
6. Code 0 if there is no variation in indexing or flagging according to person, even if other referential properties of arguments, such as animacy, number, pronominal vs. nominal status, matter.
7. Code 0 if person distinctions only trigger different overt allomorphs of flagging or indexing, but the overall alignment pattern and the position of the markers remains the same.

## Examples
**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

The alignment pattern of English flagging is conditioned by person, number and nominal/pronominal distinction. The first person (singular and plural) distinguishes S/A from P, as in (a), whereas the case marking of the second person pronouns shows neutral alignment, as in (b). English is coded 1.


```
1. First person

   a. I[S] smiled.

   b. I[S] have read this book.

   c. He saw me[P].

2. Second person

   a. You[S] smiled.

   b. You[A] have read this book.

   c. I saw you[P].
```

**Kirmanjki** (ISO 639-3: kiu, Glottolog: kirm1248)

Kirmanjki shows variations in case marking of core participants based on a number of factors: animacy, noun vs. pronoun, person distinctions and [TAM (GB095)](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB095) (Selcan 1998).
In non-past tenses, S, A and nominal inanimate Ps, as well as some pronominal P arguments (1PL, 2PL) are in the **direct** case. 
Animate nominal Ps, as well as 1SG, 2SG, 3SG and 3PL pronominal P are in the **oblique** case. 
This pattern of case marking yields neutral alignment for inanimate nouns, as well as for 1PL and 2PL pronouns, and accusative alignment for animate nouns, as well as for 1SG, 2SG and 3SG/PL pronouns. 
Because person is one of the factors, Kirmanjki is coded as 1.

GB099,Can verb stems alter according to the person of a core participant?,"## Is there verb suppletion for participant person?


## Summary
Do some verbs have two or more suppletive allomorphs whose distribution is conditioned by the person of an [S, A, or P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument? 
Suppletive allomorphs are allomorphs which are not similar in pronunciation, i.e. they cannot be related to each other by morpho-phonological rules.
This question covers strong suppletion, weak suppletion, and ablaut. 
There must be at least **three** such verbs to code 1 for this feature.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if at least three verb stems vary according to the person of S, A, and/or P arguments.
2. Code 1 if the grammar does not list the verbs but says that there are some/a few/several/couple of them.
3. Code 0 if only one or two examples are provided. Add a comment.

## Examples
**Tainae** (ISO 639-3: ago, Glottolog: tain1253)

Tainae is coded 1.
 
Carlson (1991: 92) provides a non-exhaustive list of seven verbs which have suppletive forms depending on the person of the P argument:

| Gloss  | Root | 1SG | 2SG | 3SG/SU/PL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ‘blow magic at’ | nɨ | ninɨtɨyate | ntɨsɨtɨyate | nɨptɨtɨyate |
| ‘desire’ | nɨ | ninɨtɨyate | ntɨsinɨtɨyate | nɨwinɨate |
| ‘eat’ | nɨ | nɨnɨmtɨ | ntɨnɨmtɨ | nɨmtɨ |
| ‘cook’ | to | numtɨ | ntomtɨ | tomtɨ |
| ‘kill’ | nau | numtɨ | nomtɨ | namtɨ |
| ‘hit’ | nae | ninemtɨ | ntisemtɨ | naemtɨ |
| ‘give’ | mɨnɨ | (ni)nampɨmtɨ | ntisapimtɨ | mɨnɨptɨmtɨ |

GB103,Is there a benefactive applicative marker on the verb (including indexing)?,"## Can a verb have a benefactive marker (applicative marker or index)?

## Summary
This question concerns a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) verbal marker that signals that the verb has a beneficiary. The marker could be analyzed in the language-specific case as voice, [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or a 'bound pronoun'. In some languages, applicative markers may be used to topicalize, focalize or background a beneficiary. This type of marking also counts for this feature. The marker does not have to index the beneficiary. Autobenefactive markers do not count and serial verb constructions that include a benefactive verb (typically 'give') do not count. 

## Procedure
1. Look up the sections on verbal morphology, indexing and argument structure, and adverbial modifiers.
2. If there are no such sections, search for the words 'give', 'receive', 'recipient', 'benefactive' and 'applicative'.
3. If the language has a way to index a beneficiary on verbs, code 1.
4. If the language has a way to mark on the verb that an action has a beneficiary, code 1.
5. If the language does not have a benefactive marker on verbs and does not index beneficiaries on verbs, code 0.
6. If the grammar comprehensively describes verbal morphology but does not mention the coding of beneficiaries, code 0.
7. If there is not enough information in the grammar to understand how beneficiaries are coded, code ?.

## Examples

**Arabana** (ISO 639-3: ard, Glottolog: arab1267)

In Arabana, the general transitivizer _-la-_ functions, amongst others, as a benefactive marker. Arabana is coded 1.

```
Thudni-la-thira
cry-BEN-PUNCT
‘(They) cry over someone.’ (Hercus 1994: 150)

Thanta   wirra-la-rnda
stuff    buy-BEN-PRS
‘(Father) buys dress material for (them).’ (Hercus 1994: 150)
```

**Jina** (ISO 639-3: jia, Glottolog: jina1244)

In Jina, a bound beneficiary pronoun may co-occur in a clause with a co-referential full noun phrase. Jina is coded 1 for this feature.

```
Adam   val-nara         arga   kə      Falmata
Adam   give-3SG.F.BEN   ring   DAT     Falmata
‘Adam gave falmata a ring.’ (Schmidt, Odden & Holmberg 2002: 111)

```

In continuous aspect clauses, indirect object pronouns are infixed inside a reduplicated verb (reduplication marks continuous aspect). This counts as indexing.

```
na   zal-ama-cə-zala
1SG  REDUP:CONT-2SG.F.BEN-3SG.F-send
‘I am sending her to you.’ (Schmidt, Odden & Holmberg 2002: 111)

GB105,Can the recipient in a ditransitive construction be marked like the monotransitive patient?,"## Can the recipient in a ditransitive construction be marked like the transitive patient?

## Summary
As a ditransitive construction we consider constructions with verbs expressing a physical transfer of possession or a mental transfer of messages (*give*, *lend*, *hand*, *feed*, *send*, *bring*, *show*, *tell*, *teach*). A ditransitive construction must allow overt expression of an agent, a theme and a recipient/addressee as separate NPs. The morphological marking of these arguments (e.g. accusative case, dative case vs. adposition marking) is irrelevant for counting a construction as ditransitive.

‘Marking’ for the purposes of this feature includes both flagging (i.e. case and adposition marking) and [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) on the verb. 1 is primarily triggered by flagging. Only if there is no overt flagging for neither the P argument nor the recipient argument, indexing is considered. 1 covers both the ‘double-object construction’ and the ‘secondary-object construction’ of Haspelmath (2013).

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with argument flagging (i.e. case and adposition marking) and indexing. Check whether it discusses ditransitive verbs or ditransitive constructions. If not, search the grammar for examples with verbs expressing a physical transfer.
2. If the overt flagging of the P argument and the recipient argument is identical, code as 1.
3. If the P argument and the recipient are marked with different flags, code as 0.
4. If only the P argument or only the recipient is overtly marked, code as 0.
5. If neither the P argument nor the recipient are overtly marked, consider the indexing patterns on the verb.
6. Code as 1 if the two arguments are indexed identically.
5. If the indexing of the P argument differs from the indexing of the recipient, code as 0.
6. If there is neither overt indexing not flagging for both P and the recipient, code as 1.
7. Various relevant verbs might have different marking patterns. As the question is about the possibility of the recipient in a ditransitive construction to be marked like the transitive patient, code as 1 even if not all verbs follow this pattern and add a comment.
8. Even if the author of the grammar explicitly states the language has no ditransitive verbs, still consider and code the marking of the arguments of verbs of a physical transfer.  

## Examples
**Awa-Cuaiquer** (ISO 639-3: kwi, Glottolog: awac1239)

Though only some Ps (pronouns and certain nouns) are overtly marked with the dative suffix in Awa-Cuaiquer (compare the marked P argument in (a) vs. the unmarked P argument in (b), this situation still counts as 1, as some P are identically marked with the recipient, as in (c).

```

GB107,"Can standard negation be marked by an affix, clitic or modification of the verb?","## Can standard negation be marked by an affix, clitic or modification of the verb?

## Summary
This feature refers to Standard Negation, i.e. the constructions that mark negation of (at least) dynamic (not-stative) verbal predicates in declarative mood. The marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verbal root, be it by affixation, cliticization, suppletion, reduplication, tone, etc. For markers bound to auxiliaries, see [GB298](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB298). If there is negative marking on the verb and elsewhere (for example by a particle) in the same construction, this is included in this feature. If there is a clitic that attaches to anything in its vicinity, this doesn't count.

## Procedure
1. Find the section in the available descriptive literature that deals with negation.
2. If suppletion is used, or a marker is described as an affix, a phonologically bound clitic, tone or reduplication and you see no reason to doubt that it is indeed bound, code 1.
3. If the marker is described as a particle and it is unclear whether it is bound to the verb or not, look into more sources.
4. If the marker can be bound and can be free (and you are sufficiently convinced that when it is described as bound it is indeed bound), code 1 for this feature and code 1 for [GB298](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB298) and/or [GB299](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB298).
5. If there is more than one construction for marking standard negation, code for all of them.

## Examples
**Turkish** (ISO 639-3: tur, Glottolog: nucl1301) 

Standard negation in Turkish is marked using the suffix _-mA_ on the verb (Kornfilt 1997: 123). Turkish is coded as 1 for this feature.

```
Hasan kitab-ı  oku-ma-dı
Hasan book-ACC read-NEG-PST
‘Hasan didn't read the book.’ (Kornfilt 1997: 123)
```

**Swedish** (ISO 639-3: swe, Glottolog: swed1254)

Swedish accomplishes negation with a particle (_icke_ or _inte_). It is possible for this particle to be phonologically bound to the verb, but it does not qualify for a 1 for this feature because it cliticizes to anything that precedes it - not just verbs. Below are examples from the Swedish dialect Jarssemål (spoken in Järvsö in Hälsingland). All examples are taken from Håkan Franck (1999) via Skigård (2010), with glosses and translation added by patron (also Skirgård). Swedish is coded as 0.

```
(1) free-standing
Fräsen begrep int dä där, han e.
Hisser understand NEG that there, 3SG.MASK NEG
'The kitty didn't understand that, did he?""
```

```
(2) cliticised to verb
Jasså, du Fräsen! Du tyttje=n't ôm främmande du, e.
well.then 2SG Hisser 2SG like=NEG about strangers 2SG NEG
'Well then Kitty, you don't care for strangers do you?""
```

```
(3) cliticised to pragmatic particle
Dä ä ju=n't sa långt hem tä ôss, e.
It is PRAG.PART=NEG so far home to us, NEG
'It's not that far home to us, is it?'
```

## Summary
This question concerns a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) verbal marker that signals the direction or location of the event/state/action. A marker that indicates that something happens in multiple directions does not count here.

## Procedure
1. Look up the section on verbal morphology.
2. If no such section exists or if the grammar does not provide specific information on verbal morphology, search for the terms 'direction’, 'goal', 'go’, 'come’, and 'location’.
3. If the language has no way to mark location or direction on the verb, code as 0.
4. If the verb can carry a bound marker that indicates direction or location on the verb, code 1.

## Examples

**Makuwa** (ISO 639-3: vmw, Glottolog: makh1264)

Makuwa has an applicative marker that can derive directional/locative verbs, as well as benefactive and instrumental verbs. Makuwa is coded 1 for this feature.

GB109,Is there verb suppletion for participant number?,"## Is there verb suppletion for participant number?

## Summary
Are there verbs that use a different stem depending on the number (singular, dual, plural, etc.) of a core participant? The participant triggering the suppletive choice could be [A, P, or S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). Auxiliary verbs are also considered verbs for the purpose of this feature. 

Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. An example of this is English *went* and *go*. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. Only strong suppletion (different stems) counts. There should be at least three verbs with participant number suppletion to count as 1. If only one or two verbs are described as exhibiting suppletion, code 0. If the author gives two examples but states or implies that it is more common, code 1. 

Only so called 'strong suppletion' counts here, 'weak' suppletion is not included.

## Procedure
1. Check whether the language alters its verbs according to number at all, if not, code 0.
2. Code 1 if there are three or more examples of verbs with suppletive forms for participant number
3. If there are one or two examples, consider if the author describes these as special exceptions (in which case, code 0) or part of a larger group (in which case, code 1).
4. If all examples only feature 'weak suppletion', code 0.
5. If there is little description of participant marking on verbs in general, code ?.

## Examples
**Koasati** (ISO 639-3: cku, Glottolog: koas1236)

In Koasati there exists strong suppletion for number for several verbs, as shown by the examples below from Kimball (1991: 323–324). This qualifies as 1 for this feature.

| Verb | Singular | Dual| Plural|
|-------- | ---- | ----------- |----------- |
| ‘to dwell’ | á:tal | áswan |i:san|
| ‘to sit’ | cokkó:lin | chikki:kan|i:san|
| ‘to stand’ | haccá:lin| hikki:lin| lokkó:lin|

| Verb | Singular/dual | Plural|
|-------- | ---- | ----------- |
|‘to die’|íllin|hápkan|
|‘to come’|óntin|ilmá:kan|

GB110,Is there verb suppletion for tense or aspect?,"## Is there verb suppletion for tense or aspect?

## Summary
Are there verbs that use a different stem depending on the tense or aspect (present, past, perfective etc.) they occur in? Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. An example of this is English *went* and *go*. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. Only strong suppletion (different stems) counts, ‘weak’ suppletion is not included. At least three verbal concepts should indicate different tense or aspect values with suppletive stems to trigger a 1. 

## Procedure
1. Check whether the language alters its verbs according to tense/aspect at all.
2. Code 1 if there are three or more examples of verbs with suppletive forms for aspect/tense.
3. If there are one or two examples, consider whether the author describes these as special exceptions (in which case, code 0) or part of a larger group, in which case, code 1.
4. If all examples only feature ‘weak suppletion’, code 0.
5. If there is little description of tense/aspect marking on verbs in general, code ?.

## Examples

**Kumzari** (ISO 639-3: zum, Glottolog: kumz1235)

In Kumzari there is a larger number of irregular verbs. Below is a table of some of their forms for the first person singular, based on van der Wal Anonby (2015: 94). Kumzari is coded 1 for this feature.

| Verb| Perfect| Imperfect| Irrealis |
| --- | --- | --- |--- |
| ‘to come’ | āmasī | tā'ī |byī|
| ‘to give’ | dāsī | dī | byāt |
| ‘to take’ | gisī| digī|grī|
| ‘to become’ | būsī| tī'ī |bī'ī

GB111,Are there conjugation classes?,"## Are there conjugation classes?

## Summary
Are there multiple sets of verbs that each combine with different sets of (inflectional) markers in finite forms? We are concerned with whether there is non-phonological allomorphy of finiteness marking on verbs depending on which verb is chosen. Phonological rules are not considered here but they may correlate with non-phonological allomorphy. Conjugation classes that are lexically assigned are relevant for coding this feature. Please note that a class of suppletive verbs does not count.

Look for finiteness markers such as:
* Person: first, second, third
* Number: singular, plural, dual and trial
* Gender: masculine, feminine or neuter
* Tense: present, past, or future
* Aspect: perfect, perfective, progressive
* Mood: indicative, subjunctive, imperative, optative
* Voice: active, middle, or passive


## Procedure
1. Code 1 if finite verbs are inflected differently depending on what verb is used.
2. Code 1 if there is a two-way distinction between ‘regular’ and ‘irregular’ verbs and there are more than two irregular verbs.
3. Code 0 if differences in the forms of TAM, indexing, or voice markers for finite verbs result purely from morphophonological alternations.

	
## Examples

**Kedang** (ISO 639-3: ksx, Glottolog: keda1252)

Coded 1. Kedang has 3 conjugational classes. Class 1 has fourteen verbs, which take five person and number prefixes. Class 2 has four verbs, which take two person prefixes. Class 3 has one irregular verb form which may take the same markers as class 2 or two of its own (Samely 1991: 94–95).

**Yulu** (ISO 639-3: yul, Glottolog: yulu1243) 

Coded 1. Different classes of verbs have different tonal contours when conjugated. The tonal contours of the conjugated verbs are not predictable from the uninflected forms of the verbs (Boyeldieu 1987: 169–172).

| Meaning | Citation form | 2SG conjugation | 3SG conjugation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ‘to sew’ | l-èes | èesē | ēesē |
| ‘to think’ | l-êes | èesè | ēesè |
| ‘to ignore’ | l-ìg | īgǐ | ígǐ |
| ‘to dig’ | l-ǐg | ǐgì | ǐgī |
| ‘to lift’ | l-ùul | ùulū | ūulū |
| ‘to kiss’ | l-ūul | ūulù | úulù |

**Bardi** (ISO 639-3: bcj, Glottolog: bard1255)

Coded as 0. Bowern (2004) identifies three classes of verb roots: monovalent roots which do not take the transitive prefix *n-* ~ *a-* or an object marker, bivalent roots which subcategorize for two arguments and do take the transitive prefix *n-* ~ *a-* and ambitransitive roots which have direct object marking but may not take the transitive prefix *n-* ~ *a-*. These are transitivity classes rather than conjugational classes (Bowern 2004: 134).

GB113,Are there verbal affixes or clitics that turn intransitive verbs into transitive ones?,"## Are there verbal affixes or clitics that turn intransitive verbs into transitive ones?

## Summary

This feature asks whether intransitive verbs can take a [phonologically bound morpheme](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) that signals the addition of just one role in the event denoted by the verb. This could be a causative affix or clitic, an applicative marker (benefactive, instrumental, etc.), etc. The marker has to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity). Note that there is no logical dependency with [GB155](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB155) on causative markers, as a language could have causatives that change a verb's valency from 2 to 3 but not from 1 to 2.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a grammar mentions a transitivizing marker that changes intransitive to transitive verbs, and it is phonologically bound to the verb.
2. Code 0 if a grammar mentions that there are no (phonologically bound) transitivizing markers on verbs or verb phrases.
3. Code 0 if an otherwise comprehensive grammar does not mention transitivizing markers on verbs or verb phrases. Write 'not mentioned' in the comment field.
4. Code 0 if a grammar only discusses valency decreasing operations or valency increasing operations that increase the valency of already transitive verbs, but does not mention valency increasing operations that increase the valency of an intransitive verb.
5. Code 0 if a grammar discusses phonologically free morphemes that change intransitive verbs to transitive ones, but no phonologically bound ones.
6. Code ? if you think there is not enough data or analysis to establish the presence or absence of a bound transitivizing morpheme. Write this in the comment column.

## Examples

**Ao Naga** (ISO 639-3: njo, Glottolog: aona1235)

Ao Naga (or Chungli Ao, in the source) has a causative suffix, *-taktsɨ*, which can transitivize intransitive sentences, as well as add an additional role to an already transitive clause. Ao Naga is coded 1 for this feature.

```
(Intransitive > transitive)
ni-i   la     tʃip-taktsɨ
1SG-A  3SG.F  cry-CAUS.PFV
‘I made her cry.’ (Escamilla 2012: 54–56)

(Transitive > ditransitive)
pa-i     la-nem      mapa    injak-takstsɨ
3SG.M-A  3SG.F-DAT   chore   do/work-CAUS.PFV
‘He made her do work.’ (Escamilla 2012: 54–56)
```

**Arhuaco** (ISO 639-3: arh, Glottolog: arhu1242)

Arhuaco (or Ika) has a directive applicative prefix *ka-* that can add an extra role to an intransitive clause. Arhuaco is coded 1 for this feature.

```
mi-ka-wa'ka
2SG.OBJ-APPL.DIR-look
‘It looks at you.’ (Frank 1985: 93; glosses by Haspelmath & Müller-Bardey 2004: 107)
```

**Barain** (ISO 639-3: bva, Glottolog: bare1279)

Like other Chadic languages, Barain has fossilized remains of a system of intransitive-causative vowel alternation, which is no longer productive (Lovestrand 2012: 126–127). There is no other transitivizing morphology (although there is a passive, reflexive and reciprocal). Barain is coded as 0.

GB114,Is there a phonologically bound reflexive marker on the verb?,"## Is there a phonologically bound reflexive marker on the verb?

## Summary

A reflexive marker indicates that a participant is coreferential with another participant in the clause or sentence. This marker may indicate both reflexive and reciprocal functions. If a ‘middle-voice’ marker is used to mark reflexive functions, it also counts as a reflexive marker. Reduplication of verbs also counts. The reflexive construction needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not limited to a small set of likely lexicalized verbs in the language, to trigger 1 for this feature. This question targets lexical verbs, anything that happens with auxiliaries is not relevant for this feature.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if the grammar discusses a productive reflexive marker that is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) to the verb. Middle voice markers that are obligatory in reflexive constructions also count as reflexive markers.
2. Code 1 if the grammar discusses a marker that is phonologically bound to the verb and it encodes both reflexive and reciprocal functions.
3. Code 0 if the grammar discusses reciprocal markers or a phonologically independent reflexive marker, but does not mention a phonologically bound reflexive marker on verbs. Write 'not mentioned' in the comment column.
4. Code 0 if the grammar only discusses unproductive reflexive markers on verbs.
5. Code 0 if an otherwise comprehensive grammar does not discuss reflexive markers. Write ‘not mentioned’ in the comment column.
6. Code ? if there is not enough data or analysis in the available sources to determine whether there is a bound reflexive marker on verbs or whether it is productive.

## Examples

**Hokkaido Ainu** (ISO 639-3: ain, Glottolog: ainu1240)

Hokkaido Ainu has a reflexive prefix *yay-* (Tamura 2000: 204). This language is coded 1 for this feature.

```
kik        ‘to hit’
yay-kik    ‘to hit oneself’

nuyna      ‘to hide’
yay-nuya   ‘to hide oneself’
```

**Yimas** (ISO 639-3: yee, Glottolog: yima1243)

Yimas does not have any specialized reflexives, and receives a 0 value for this feature: ""Yimas lacks any coherent way of forming reflexive constructions"" (Foley 1991: 286).


**Rapanui** (ISO 639-3: rap, Glottolog: rapa1244)

Rapanui does not have a specialized reflexive form, and receives a value of 0. Semantically reflexive clauses are just expressed with the regular pronoun for the person performing the action (Kieviet 2017: 432–433).

```
¿Ko    haŋa    'ā     koe    mo    hore   atu    i     a   koe?
PRF    want    CONT   2SG    for   cut    away   ACC   ART 2SG
‘Do you want to cut yourself?’ (Kieviet 2017: 432)
```

## Summary

A reciprocal marker indicates that an action or feeling is mutual between two or more parties (e.g. *they love each other*; *they beat each other*). A reciprocal marker may indicate both reflexive and reciprocal functions. Reduplication of verbs also counts. Reciprocal marking needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not limited to a small set of verbs in the language that are probably lexicalized. This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) reciprocal markers.

## Procedure

1. Explore the sections discussing argument marking, pronouns, verbal morphology, verbal derivation, valency change, argument structure and simple clauses.
2. Code 1 if the grammar discusses a productive reciprocal marker that is phonologically bound to the verb.
3. Code 1 if the grammar discusses a marker that is phonologically bound to the verb and it encodes both reflexive and reciprocal functions.
4. Code 0 if the grammar discusses reflexive markers or a phonologically independent reciprocal marker, but doesn't mention a phonologically bound reciprocal marker on verbs. Write 'not mentioned’ in the comment column.
5. Code 0 if the grammar only discusses unproductive reciprocal markers on verbs.
6. Code 0 if an otherwise comprehensive grammar does not discuss reciprocal markers. Write 'not mentioned’ in the comment column.
7. Code ? if there is not enough data or analysis in the grammar to determine whether there is a bound reflexive marker on verbs or whether it is productive.

## Examples

**Kuku-Yalanji** (ISO 639-3: gvn, Glottolog: kuku1273)

Kuku-Yalanji has a dedicated reciprocal suffix *-wa* (Patz 2002: 103). Kuku-Yalanji is coded 1.

```
nyaji-l ‘see’           →  nyaji-wa-y ‘see each other’
kunja-l ‘call, summon’  →  kunja-wa-y ‘call each other’
binal-bunga-l ‘teach’   →  binal-bunga-wa-y ‘teach each other’
murru-kanga-l ‘scold’   →  murru-kanga-wa-y ‘scold each other’
```

**Umbundu** (ISO 639-3: umb, Glottolog: umbu1257)

In Umbundu, the same prefix *li-* is used for both reflexive and reciprocal derivations. Umbundu is coded 1.

```
oku-li-mon-a
INF-REFL/REC/-see-a
'to see one's self’ or ‘to see each other’ (Stover 1885: 46)
``` 

**Rapanui** (ISO 639-3: rap, Glottolog: rapa1244)

Rapanui doesn't have a reciprocal construction; semantically reciprocal clauses are just expressed with the regular personal pronouns (Kieviet 2017: 433). It is coded 0.

GB116,"Do verbs classify the shape, size or consistency of absolutive arguments by means of incorporated nouns, verbal affixes or suppletive verb stems?","## Do verbs classify the shape, size or consistency of absolutive arguments by means of incorporated nouns, verbal affixes or suppletive verb stems?

## Summary
This question aims to capture the classification of shape, size or consistency of absolutive arguments with verbal classifiers. Incorporated nouns, verbal affixes or suppletive verb stems are types of [verbal classifiers](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers). This feature is concerned with verbal classifiers and not whether the verb agrees with the [gender/noun class](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) of the noun. Verbal classifiers can, however, be identical or very similar to possessive, numeral or demonstrative classifier systems.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there are verbal classifiers such as incorporated nouns, verbal affixes or suppletive verb stems which classify the shape, size or consistency of absolutive arguments,
2. And if they do not simply express verbal agreement with the gender/noun class of the noun.
3. Code 0 if there is no system of verbal classification which indicates the shape, size or consistency of absolutive arguments.
4. Code ? if the distinction between verbal classifiers and noun class agreement is unclear in the grammar. 


## Examples

**Anindilyakwa** (ISO 639-3: aoi, Glottolog: anin1240)  

Coded 1. In the following example, the classification of shape is captured by nominal incorporation of *rreku* ‘long.and.flexible’ and further specified by the external nominal *mvngarukwa* ‘fishing line’. There is also agreement on the verb with the vegetable noun class (the noun class marks non-humans), however, this is not relevant to this feature as we are interested in verbal classifiers and not agreement on the verb with noun class. 
```
narrv-ma-rreku-wurra-ngv-ma               abvrrv-lhangwa     mvngarukwa
3AUG-VE-long.and.flexible-throw-PST-ma    3AUG-POSS          VE.fishing.line
‘they have thrown out their fishing lines’ (van Egmond 2012: 237)
```

**Navajo** (ISO 639-3: nav, Glottolog: nava1243)
 
Coded 1. Navajo has classificatory verbs. Verbal stems agree with the status of an object to indicate how it is either positioned, shaped, sized and/or what its consistency is. In the following examples, both sentences indicate somebody being given a coke. In (a) the stem _-'aah_ for a ‘solid, roundish object’ (SRO) is used and in (b) the stem _kaah_ meaning 'object in an open container' (OC) is used (Williams 2009: 194).

```
a. coke  naa      nish-'aah 
   coke  for.you  it.I.give-SRO
   ‘I give you a coke (in an unopened can or bottle)’ (Williams 2009: 194)

b. coke   naa       nish-kaah 
   coke   for.you   it-I-give-OC 
   ‘I give you a coke (in a cup)’ (Williams 2009: 194)

GB117,Is there a copula for predicate nominals?,"## Is there a copula for predicate nominals?

## Summary

Is there a copula in use in an equative sentence when the predicate is a nominal? The copula must be expressed in at least some equative sentences with predicate nominals but need not be obligatory in these constructions. Both verbal copulas and pro-copulas (e.g. demonstratives or personal pronouns that link the subject and predicate nominals) are relevant for this feature. Please note that adjectives are not included within the category of ‘nominals’ here. Please note copulas may be free forms, affixes, or clitics. 

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is an element which can be used with predicatively used nominals, even if it is restricted to certain contexts, and even if this marker has other functions and may, for example, function as demonstrative elsewhere.  
2. Code 0 if the grammar describes equative copular clauses with predicate nominals and describes these as using a ‘zero copula’.
3. Code 0 if there is no copula in use in an equative sentence, even if there is a copula in use for locational predicates and/or adjectival predicates.

## Examples

**Haitian** (ISO 639-3: hat, Glottolog: hait1244) 


Coded 1, a copula is required for predicate nominals. No copula is required for predicates consisting of adjectives or expressing location.

```
a. Predicate nominals:

M  se  jounalis.
I  COP journalist
‘I'm a journalist.’ (Valdman 1988: 83)

b. Predicative adjectives:

Li bon.
it good
‘It is good.’ (Valdman 1988: 83)
```

**Abui** (ISO 639-3: abz, Glottolog: abui1241)  

Coded 0. In Abui, there is no copula that links the nominal predicate with its argument. In the example, the bare NP *kalieta* ‘old person’ serves as a nominal predicate.
```
raha   kalieta 
chief  old.person
‘The chief is an old person.’ (Kratochvíl 2007: 161)
```

GB118,Are there serial verb constructions?,"## Are there serial verb constructions?

## Summary
This summary of serial verb constructions from [Haspelmath (2016: 296)](http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/Files/LL/Docments/Journals/17.3/LLN17.3-Haspelmath.pdf) serves as a good clarification: ""A serial verb construction is a monoclausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element linking them and with no predicate–argument relation between the verbs.""

Serial verbs are different from verb compounds, in that they are compositional: ""a serial verb construction must be a productive schematic
CONSTRUCTION such that the meaning of a concrete construct can be determined on the basis of the meanings of its parts and the construction meaning. This means that non-compositional combinations of verbs do not fall within the definition."" By contrast, verbal compounds are lexicalized and often non-compositional.  

Serial verb constructions are also defined in Grambank as different from clause-chaining. Clause chaining involves a series of verbs which are not inflected, and one verb which is (see [GB150](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB150)). A serial verb construction is defined using Haspelmath's definition above, but in addition where it is not an example of clause chaining (i.e. it is not true that there is an inflected verb and the other verbs are missing inflection).  It is however possible for a language to have both serial verb constructions and clause chaining.

Serial verb constructions are also different from light verb constructions, which are made up of a verbal element and a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb, jointly determining argument structure (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB123)).  

'Verb' here refers to words that can be used as independent verbs in the language in question; but it is also best if they are dynamic verbs, as per the definition in Haspelmath (2016), 'Verbs are defined as dynamic event expressions that do not have special coding when used in predication function'. Serial verb constructions which are more restricted than that, such as only applying to stative verbs (e.g. a verb meaning 'good'), should not be counted as 1.


## Procedure
1. Code 1 if two or more verbs can be juxtaposed, this verbal sequence functions as a single predicate, there is no predicate-argument relationship between the verbs, and where it is not a case of clause chaining, i.e. it is not true that there is an inflected verb and the other verbs are missing inflection.
2. Code 0 if you find no description or examples of serial verb constructions in an otherwise comprehensive grammar.
3. Code ? if the only potential examples of serial verb constructions in a language can also be analyzed as verbal compounds.
4. Code ? if there are no examples of serial verb constructions but you believe the authors of your sources may have missed serial verb constructions.

## Examples

**Ewe** (ISO 639-3: ewe, Glottolog: ewee1241)

Coded 1. ""Subject is only expressed with the first verb. Some of the verbs may share objects as is the case for ‘dig’, ‘cook’ and ‘eat’ in the sentence below. Serialising connectives may be used to link verbs in a series"" (Ameka 1991: 58).
```
é-fɔ́      do go      le zã    me dazáá   ɖa-ku     te   ɖa    ɖu
3SG-arise go outside at night in quietly PURP-dig  yam  cook  eat  
‘He got out quietly at night, dug up yams, cooked them and ate them.’ (Ameka 1991: 58)
```

**Dongxiang** (ISO 639-3: sce, Glottolog: dong1285)

Coded 0. The following is an example of clause chaining, not serial verbs. The first three verbs are non-finite (‘take’, ‘make’, ‘hang’) and each take a non-finite marker. The final verb (‘eat’) is the only finite verb and takes an aspectual marker. The first three verbs are medial verbs, and the finite verb occurs sentence-finally where main verbs usually occur in Dongxiang.

```
bi     tʂi-ni  barisə dʑiəku niə saji-dzi        dʑiauliədʑi=dəə idʑiə=nə.

GB119,"Can mood be marked by an inflecting word (""auxiliary verb"")?","## Can mood be marked by an inflecting word (‘auxiliary verb’)?

## Summary
This feature covers all grammatical moods (the relationship between the referred event/state/action and other possible worlds, or speaker's attitude) and aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) elements that inflect (i.e. change form depending on person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These markers are often described as ‘auxiliary verbs’ in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels by some authors (such as STAMP morphemes (STAM = Subject-Tense-Aspect-Mood-Polarity) or inflecting pronouns). We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking. 

There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that a mood is expressed by a certain form on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing mood then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB119) and the feature on bound mood marking ([GB312](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB312)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing a mood, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.

While negation or interrogation can be considered as grammatical moods, they are not included in this feature.

## Procedure
1. Look up the section on mood marking in the grammatical description.
2. Consider all marking of mood, e.g. not only conditional.
3. If you do not find any inflecting words expressing mood, such as auxiliary verbs or elements analyzed as pronouns that take TAM marking, code as 0.
4. If there is an inflecting word (e.g. an auxiliary verb) that clearly expresses mood, code the language as 1.
5. If it is not clear whether the inflecting word marks mood, code the language as ?.

## Examples

**Turkish** (ISO 639-3: vma, Glottolog: mart1255)

In Turkish, the verb ‘to be’ _ol_ forms an auxiliary verb together with a bound mood marker. The following is an example with necessitative mood. Turkish is coded as 1 for this feature.

```
Ali   oda-ya    gir-erken   Hasan  iş-in-i       bit-ir-iyor      ol-malı-y-dı
Ali   room-DAT  enter-while Hasan  work-3SG-ACC  finish-CAUS-PROG be-NEC-COP-PST

GB122,Is verb compounding a regular process?,"## Is verb compounding a regular process?

## Summary
Verbal compounds are lexicalized, often non-compositional, constructions which combine two or more verb stems.  Languages with [serial verb constructions](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118) can often have verb compounds too, however they might not always be described as such.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is a conventionalized way of combining two verbal elements into a single lexicalized phonological and grammatical word.
2. Code 0 if it is clear the two elements are phonologically independent.
3. Code ? if it is unclear how [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) this process is in the language.

## Examples

**Sichuan Yi** (ISO 639-3: iii, Glottolog: sich1238 )

Coded 1. Verbal compounds relate to the meaning of their components in the following four major ways. (a) The verbs are unrelated, (b) the verbs are in an antonymic relationship, (c) the verbs are parallel in their meaning, (d) the second verb denotes the resultative state of the initial verb.

```
(a) la   hxex 
    come see
    ‘wait’

(b) it  dep 
    lie rise
    ‘rise’

(c) hxep hna
    see listen
    ‘take care’

(d) hna  cie
    hear clear
    ‘hear clearly’

(Gerner 2013: 60)
```
**Menya** (ISO 639-3: mcr, Glottolog: meny1245)

Coded 1. In (a) the verb *kii* ‘grab’ is seen individually, and in (b) the verb *qiil* ‘hold’ is also seen individually. However, in (c) both the verb *kii* ‘hold’ and *qiil* ‘hold’ are compounded together. Both verbs are transitive and when combined, the compound is also transitive.

```
(a) nyi  i=que      a    ä-kä-k-qäqä=i~
    1SG  that=M=OBJ hand ASS-grab-PST/PFV-1SG/DSO=IND

A light-verb construction is a lexicalized complex predicate with two components: (1) a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb and (2) an inflectable verb, which is called the light verb. It is form-identical with a main verb, but used with a different meaning such that it ‘cannot be said to be predicating fully' (examples in English include _give a sigh_ or _take a plunge_) (Butt 2003).

Items that can occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions are: (1) nouns (e.g. *do baby* in Ivorian English or *have sex* in English for ‘to copulate’), (2) adjectives (e.g. *make beautiful* in English), (3) non-inflectable items such as ideophones (e.g. *do ssss* for ‘to make an ssss sound’), or (4) verbs borrowed from other languages that do not inflect in the target language. 

Regular verbs cannot occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions, in the Grambank definition. This makes light verb constructions different from serial verb constructions and verbal compounding, which involve a sequence of more than one verb. Another difference is that there is a predicate-argument relationship between the light verb and the other lexical stem (e.g. in *do baby*, *baby* is the object of *do*), while in serial verb constructions the verbs do not have a predicate-argument relationship between them since they instead describe a sequence of events. 

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if verbs with a general meaning may combine with a non-verbal element to produce new verbal predicates. If this is not explicitly mentioned in the grammar's chapter on verbs, check example sentences or word lists. 
2. Code 0 if you do not find examples of new verbal predicates formed by a combination of a verb and a non-verbal element, or if all of these instances can be analyzed as serial verb constructions or verbal compounds.

## Examples
**Korafe-Yegha**  (ISO 639-3: kpr, Glottolog: kora1294)

In Korafe-Yegha, nouns frequently combine with a generic verb to form new predicates. The generic verbs include meanings such as ‘do’, ‘say’, ‘see’, ‘hit’, ‘spear’, ‘do again’, ‘hold’, ‘get’ (Farr 1999: 63–66). Korafe-Yegha is coded 1.

```
boare de        tattoo hit            ‘tattoo (someone)’
ambe de         sago hit              ‘process sago’
jinogu tam bu   swoon find            ‘swoon’
ata gae         foot spear            ‘spear/sting foot’
bairobo bu      choice of catch get   ‘get first pick of catch’
buri dighi      tether tie            ‘tether’
uvu mindi       liquid consume        ‘drink’
oka bambu       fish get              ‘catch fish’
```

**Mandarin Chinese** (ISO 693-3: cmn, Glottolog: mand1415)

Butt (2003: 9–10) describes one construction in Mandarin as a light verb which, however, is not a light verb construction by the definition in Grambank. It would instead be counted as an example of verb compounding (""lexicalized, often non-compositional, constructions which combine two or more verb stems"" according to [GB122](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB122)). Languages where the only examples of potential light verb constructions are of this kind should be coded 0.

```

GB124,Is incorporation of nouns into verbs a productive intransitivizing process?,"## Is incorporation of nouns into verbs a productive intransitivizing process?

## Summary
Noun incorporation is defined as a construction where obligatorily bare (i.e. articleless, numberless, modifierless) nouns must occur adjacent to or inside of the verb, in a fixed order. This feature essentially asks whether transitive verbs may be rendered intransitive by means of noun incorporation, and whether this process is productive. This need not be the default way of intransitivizing verbs, but the process must be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity). The incorporated noun in the construction of interest for this feature is semantically an argument of the verb. For example: *he was painting the bike* = *he was bike-painting*. Noun incorporation where the relevant noun functions as an adjunct or modifier does not count, e.g. *she was running like Jacob runs* = *she was Jacob-running*. A construction where it is necessary to overtly represent the relevant argument with an additional form other than the incorporated noun, for example with a pronoun, also does not count.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is a strategy for intransitivizing verbs that either binds a bare nominal morphologically to the verb, or requires a bare nominal to be positioned immediately adjacent to the verb.
2. Code 0 if the nominal involved in this construction is not obligatorily bare.
3. Code 0 if the nominal involved in this construction does not express an argument of the verb.
4. Code 0 if the incorporated argument must also be expressed by an overt element elsewhere in the syntax (e.g. a pronoun) in addition to the verb-adjacent nominal.			

## Examples

**Comanche** (ISO 639-3: com, Glottolog: coma1245)

Comanche noun incorporation intransitivizes a verb, and is commonly used to express habitual activities. The incorporated noun must be a bare root with no number or case marking (Charney 1993: 123). Comanche would be coded 1. 

*Noun Incorporation*  

```
[pukumakwIɁetɨ urɨɨ]
puku-makwih-Ɂe-tɨɨ=utɨɨ
horse-chase-DISTR-PL=3PL
‘They're chasing horses.’ (Charney 1993: 123)

(notes: DISTR = distributive aspect; glosses adapted)
```

*Non-incorporated Direct Object*  

```
[ehka   nɨɨ waɁóɁa  makwIɁepɨnnitƗ]
eHka    nɨɨ waɁóɁ-a makwih-Ɂe-h/H/pɨnni-tɨ=
those.O 1SG cat-O   chase-DISTR-IPFV-PROG
‘I'm chasing the cats.’ (Charney 1993: 123)
```

**Kuuk Thaayorre** (ISO 639-3: thd, Glottolog: thay1249)

There are a number of verbal forms in Kuuk Thaayorre that include a body part noun and a verbal root, as shown in the example below.

```
bottle       table-ak   thaa+raaki-rr
bottle(ACC)  table-DAT  mouth+PLACE-P.PFV
‘she put the bottle on the table’ (Gaby 2006: 432)
```

While the nominal components of these noun + verb compounds in Kuuk Thaayorre can transparently represent theme arguments of the verb (e.g. *koo-mi'i* nose-pick.up = ‘recognize (someone's face)’, Gaby 2006: 433), they do not meet the other criteria for this feature. First, this construction is attested with a small number of body part terms and it is unclear how productive it is. Second, the valency of the verb is unaffected by this construction (Gaby 2006: 432). Kuuk Thaayorre is coded 0.

GB126,Is there an existential verb?,"## Is there an existential verb?

## Summary
Is there an element expressing existential predication (*A book on that topic **exists**.*/*There **is** a book on that topic.*), that is **different from the equative or attributive copula**? It is possible that there are various existential verbs making further distinctions, temporary versus permanent existence, or that there is a special negative existential verb. The existential marker can be used for the expression of other functions, such as aspect, as long as it is **not** identical to the copula of identity or attribution (as is the case with *is*, *That book **is** part of a series.* and *That book **is** great*). The existential element need not fulfill all formal criteria to qualify as a verb. The existence of a negative existential alone is not sufficient for a 1. Locational or positional verbs are also not enough for a 1.

## Procedure
1. Find the existential constructions in the language.
2. Find the equational and attributive constructions.
3. Code 1 if there is an overt existential element that is different from both the equative and attributive elements, if there are any.
4. Code 0 if there is no existential verb or if the existential verb is identical to the equative or attributive element.

## Examples
**Swedish** (ISO 639-3: swe, Glottolog: swed1254) 

Swedish has a verb that is different from the copula of identity and attribution (*är*) and also from positional verbs (*sitta*, *stå*, *ligga*, etc.) (Svenska Akademien [2015: 296](http://spraakdata.gu.se/saolhist/sid_popup.php?bildfil=SAOL14//SAOL14_00296.png)). The verb is *finnas* (Hedvig Skirgård, p.c.). Swedish is coded 1 for this feature.

Existential verb: _finnas_
```
det finns inga spöke-n
it  exist no   ghost-PL
‘There are no ghosts.’ (Svenska Akademien 2015: 296)
```

Copula used to mark identity predication: *är*
```
Sheena är en punkare
Sheena is a  punk.rocker  
‘Sheena is a punk rocker.’ (Svenska Akademien 2015: 296)
```

Locational verb marking position

GB127,Are different posture verbs used obligatorily depending on an inanimate locatum's shape or position (e.g. 'to lie' vs. 'to stand')?,"## Are different posture verbs used obligatorily depending on an inanimate locatum's shape or position (e.g. ‘to lie’ vs. ‘to stand’)?

## Summary

In some languages, locative predication (‘X is at Y’) always requires the use of a posture verb (e.g. ‘X sits at Y’ vs. ‘X lies at Y’). The posture verb depends on the shape or the position of the item that is located. For example, a bottle may always ‘stand’ somewhere and a ball may always ‘lie’ somewhere.  In these languages, a speaker could not simply say that something ‘is’ somewhere. Some posture verbs that may occur in languages are verbs for sitting, standing, hanging and lying. Note that this feature does not concern morphological marking of position or shape, but the use of different verbs for this purpose. If the posture verbs are clearly dominant in frequency this is sufficient to count as obligatory for the purpose of this question, even if non-posture verb alternatives are grammatical.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if verb roots (not verb morphology) which express location (such as *is* in *the book is on the table*) also encode the posture (‘lie’, ‘stand’, ‘sit’, ‘hang’, e.g. *the book lies on the table* meaning ‘the book is on the table’), and if there is no frequently used more general way of encoding location. This should be clear in a grammar's section on simple clauses, specifically where it discusses predication of location (‘X is at/in Y’).
2. Code 0 if expressions of location do not usually encode posture. A look at texts and examples should give you an idea of this.
3. Code ? if you cannot find clear examples of locational predication.

## Examples

**Meyah** (ISO 639-3: mej, Glottolog: meya1236)

In Meyah, different positional verbs are obligatorily used to predicate the existence and location of (a) humans, (b) animals, trees, corn stalks, and houses, and (c) snakes, ants, rocks, yams, water, rainbows. The position of humans is encoded with the verb *eker* ‘to sit’. Members of category (b), which includes animals and inanimate objects that have legs, are located with the verb *ot* ‘to stand’. Members of category (c), which have in common that they don't have any legs, are located with the verb *ah* ‘to lie’ (Gravelle 2004: 223). Meyah is coded 1.

```
(a) Humans sit:

Idu  bera en-eker   gu  mei
Idu  TOP  DUR-sit   in  water
‘Who is in the water?’ (Gravelle 2004: 224)

(b) Nonhuman leg-possessing entities stand:

Mega  mos  ongga  en-ot      gij  Iskuruk
tree  mos  REL	  DUR-stand  in   Iskuruk
‘The mos tree that is in Iskuruk village…’ (Gravelle 2004: 224)

(c) Legless entities lie:

Ineymes  en-ah        gu  monuh  Mandacan
Ineymes  DUR-lie.down at  place  Mandacan
‘Ineymes village is in the Mandacan area.’ (Gravelle 2004: 224)
```

**Standard Dutch** (ISO 639-3: nld, Glottolog: dutc1256)

In Standard Dutch, there is a composite generic verb *zich bevinden* which can be used to specify the location of an entity without indicating its posture. It is, however, rarely used in day-to-day speech, and usually either _staan_ ‘to stand’, as in (a), or *liggen* ‘to lie’, as in (b) is used when referring to something's location. The verb that is used depends on the shape and the position of the located item. Dutch gets a 1 for this feature.

```
(a) staan ‘to stand'
De   fles   staa-t      in  de   kamer   hier-naast.
DEF  bottle stand-3SG   in  DEF  room    here-beside 
‘The bottle is in the room next door.’ (Jakob Lesage, p.k.)

(b) liggen ‘to lie'
De   bal  lig-t   in   de   kamer   hier-naast.
DEF  ball lie-3SG in   DEF  room    here-beside 
‘The ball is in the room next door.’ (Jakob Lesage, p.k.)
```

**Hatam** (ISO 639-3: had, Glottolog: hata1243)

Hatam has a generic verb *jo* which can be used to refer to an entity's location without specifying the posture of that entity. There are also posture verbs, but they are not used obligatorily, or by default, in locative predication constructions. Notably, in the examples below, posture verbs are only used for animate entities. Hatam is coded 0.

Use of the generic verb _jo_:
```
Lampu   jo   gau     meja  (dip).
lamp    be   above   table top
‘The lamp is above the table.’ (Reesink 1999: 64)

Ni-mmeng   mui  jo  tai     biei.
3SG-leaf   dry  be  around  tree
‘There are dry leaves (directly) around the tree.’ (Reesink 1999: 64)

Srad    jo  ghai    dani.
book    be  around  me
‘The books are scattered around me.’ (Reesink 1999: 64)
```

Use of posture verbs:

```
No    gwam    ei    meja    behei.
he    sit     LOC   table   under
‘He is sitting under the table.’ (Reesink 1999: 62)

Ya     ei    biei   behei.
stand  LOC   tree   under
‘He is standing under a tree.’ (Reesink 1999: 62)

Minsien bong   ei   ig     ne-te      hi.
dog     lie    LOC  house  3SG-side   other
‘The dog is lying beside the house.’ (Reesink 1999: 63)
```

**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

English is like Hatam, in that location of inanimate entities is usually specified with *to be*, and not with a posture verb, although English also has posture verbs such as *lie*, *stand*, *sit* and *hang*. English is also coded 0.

GB129,"Is there a notably small number, i.e. about 100 or less, of verb roots in the language?","## Is there a notably small number of verb roots in the language?

## Summary
This feature tracks languages with few members in the word class which is most commonly known as ‘verbs’. If the word class ‘verbs’ contains approximately 100 roots or less, the language qualifies for this feature.  

A large part of the grammar may be devoted to constructions where a verb from the closed class combines with open-class items to form predicates in most sentences. If a grammar never remarks on the size of the verbal inventory this almost always means that the language does not have a small number of verbs in the sense of the present question. If a language has a small number of verbs in this sense, typically a description will say that there is a closed class of verbs with few members. 

In such languages, it is typically the case that what is described by one verb in other languages is instead expressed by so called ‘light verb constructions’ (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB123)). For example, *do meeting* could express the meaning ‘to meet’. It is also possible for a language to have few verbs but no light-verb constructions.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there are fewer than 100 verbs in the language based on statements in a grammar or dictionary.
2. Code 1 if the descriptions describes verbs as a very restricted word class with few members even if a precise number is not given.
3. Code 0 if there is no mention of verbs being a restricted word class in any sense.

## Examples

**Jaminjung-Ngaliwurru** (ISO 639-3: djd, Glottolog: djam1255)

Jaminjung-Ngaliwurru is an example of a language with only around 30 verbs (Schultze-Bernt 2000: 83). This language is coded 1 for this feature.

GB130,What is the pragmatically unmarked order of S and V in intransitive clauses?,"## What is the pragmatically unmarked order of S and V in intransitive clauses?

## Summary
This feature focuses on the relative order of subject and verb in intransitive clauses. All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider ‘left or right-dislocation’, accompanied by intonational signals, or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts. The position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored.

## Procedure
1. Find the order of core arguments in the language, either in the text of the grammar or in examples involving full NP subjects.
2. Code 1 if the order in intransitive clauses with a full nominal subject is consistently SV.
3. Code 2 if the order in intransitive clauses with a full nominal subject is consistently VS.
4. Code 3 if both SV and VS order occur in pragmatically unmarked intransitive clauses with full nominal subjects. Do not count focus constructions or left- or right-dislocation.
5. Code ? only if it is unclear whether the examples in which one of the two possible orders occurs meet the pragmatically unmarked criterion. Include a comment describing the relevant construction(s).

## Examples

**Makhuwa** (ISO 639-3: vmw, Glottolog: makh1264)

Available examples of intransitive clauses with full NP subjects in Makhuwa show SV order, as in the example below.
```
mwanámwáné    o-ná-mwéétta
CL1.child     CL1-PRS.DJ-walk
‘the child walks’ (van der Wal 2009: 70)
```
Makhuwa is coded 1.

**Longgu** (ISO 639-3: lgu, Glottolog: long1395)

The basic word order of Longgu is described as V(O)S, though the grammatical description also describes pragmatically marked constructions where a nominal subject is fronted to indicate a new topic or for contrastive focus (Hill 2002: 554). Pragmatically unmarked transitive clauses therefore have VS order, as in the example below, which is analyzed by the grammar writer as syntactically intransitive (Hill 1992: 19).
```
ara  vai-hu-vi        ngaia  vanoa-na    komu-i-na
3PL  RECP-shout-TR    3SG    people-3SG  village-SG-DEI
‘the people of the village shouted to each other’ (Hill 2002: 554)

(Abbreviations: DEI = ‘deictic’, TR = ‘transitive suffix’)
```
Longgu is coded 2.

**Seneca** (ISO 639-3: see, Glottolog: sene1264)

Chafe (2015: 147) describes Seneca as having relatively free word order. Full NP subjects can precede or follow the verb, as in the examples below.
```
hö:gak  shadíäta’
hö:gak  s-hati-hrat-ha’
geese   REP-M.PL.A-go.by-HAB
‘geese go by again’ (Chafe 2015: 183)

de’ónesdo:h                   neh     lake  ahsöh

NEG-NEUT.SG.P-be.frozen-STAT  namely  lake  still
‘the lake isn't still frozen’ (Chafe 2015: 174)
```
Seneca is coded 3.

## Summary
This feature focuses on the relative order of the verb and its [core arguments](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) in a transitive clause. Any constituents other than the core arguments (A, P) and the verb of a transitive clause should be ignored. All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider ‘left or right-dislocation’, accompanied by intonational signals or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts. The position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored. 

## Procedure
1. Find the order of core arguments in the language, either in the text of the grammar or in examples involving full NP core arguments.
2. Code 1 if the pragmatically unmarked constituent order is consistently VSO.
3. Code 1 if the pragmatically unmarked constituent order is consistently VOS.
4. Code 1 if the unmarked constituent order is free and the author states that there is a pragmatically unmarked constituent order which is verb-initial for transitive clauses.
5. Code 1 if the unmarked constituent order is free and there are examples of a pragmatically unmarked constituent order which is verb-initial for transitive clauses.
6. Code 0 if the grammar states that the language has a fixed word order for transitive clauses that is not VSO or VOS.
7. Code 0 if the grammar states the language has free or flexible word order but verb-initial constituent order is pragmatically marked.
8. Code 0 if the constituent order is verb-initial only in examples involving pragmatic marking (contrastive markers, inferential markers, topic change, foregrounding, etc.).
9. Code ? if the pragmatically unmarked constituent order(s) is not mentioned and cannot be determined by examining examples.

## Examples

**Nez Perce** (ISO 639-3: nez, Glottolog: nezp1238)

Word order in Nez Perce is very free. According to Crook (1999: 231–232) any of the logically possible orders of a transitive verb and its A and P arguments is permissible, as shown in the following example:
```
ˀáayàtom   páaqnˀìsaqa          qèiqíine
ˀáayat-um  pee-qnˀíi-see-qa     eqi.it-ne
woman-ERG  3ON3-dig-INCMPL-PST  qeqiit-OBJ
‘The woman was digging the qeqiit (an edible root).’ (Crook 1999: 231)

Other available word orders:
ˀáayàtom  qèiqíine  páaqnˀìsaqa
  S          O          V

páaqnˀìsaqa  ˀáayàtom  qèiqíine
  V             S        O 

páaqnˀìsaqa  qèiqíine  ˀáayàtom
  V            O         S

qèiqíine  páaqnˀìsaqa  ˀáayàtom
  O         V            S

qèiqíine  ˀáayàtom  páaqnˀìsaqa
  O         S         V
```
Because the available word orders in pragmatically unmarked transitive clauses with full NP arguments include V-initial orders, Nez Perce is coded 1.

**Lao** (ISO 639-3: lao, Glottolog: laoo1294)

According to Enfield (2007: 272), the closest word order pattern to a pragmatically unmarked constituent order for transitive clauses is A/S-V-O. In other words, the verb is not initial in pragmatically unmarked clauses (as in the example below). Lao is coded 0.
```
phuø   pên3  mia2  khòòng3  thaaw4     nan4       hên3  qavaj2ñavaq1  khòòng3  faaj1  coon3
MC.HUM COP   wife  of       young.man  DEM.NPROX  see   organ         of       side   bandit
‘That young man’s wife saw the bandit’s genitals.’ (Enfield 2007: 273)
```

9. Code ? if the pragmatically unmarked constituent order(s) is not mentioned and cannot be determined by examining examples.

## Examples
**Central Khmer** (ISO 639-3: khm, Glottolog: cent1989)

Central Khmer is coded as 1 based on examples like the one below, which is described as illustrating the ""standard"" pattern.
```
ka'se'kaw:   samlap    ko:n    cru:k
farmer       kill      child   pig
‘(The) farmer(s) kill(s)/killed (the) piglet(s).’ (Haiman 2011: 203)
```

**Jaminjung-Ngaliwurru** (ISO 639-3: djd, Glottolog: djam1255)

Jaminjung-Ngaliwurru is coded as 1, as constituent order is free. ""There is no evidence that any of the possible orderings of arguments with respect to the verb is more ‘basic’, more neutral or more frequent than the others."" (Schultze-Bernd 2000: 108)
```
jalyi   burrb   gan-angga-m             jajaman-ni
leaf    finish  3SG.3SG-get/handle-PRS  wind-ERG
‘the wind is blowing off all the leaves.’ (Schultze-Bernd 2000: 108)
```

**Irish** (ISO 639-3: gle, Glottolog: iris1253)

Irish is coded as 1. The inflected verb is usually clause-initial; however, in the progressive construction, the first element is an inflected copula, whereas the lexical verb follows the subject.
```
Tá    Séamas   ag    oscailt   an    dorais.
is    James    at    open.VN   the   door.GEN
‘James is opening the door.’ (Doyle 2001: 67)

(Abbreviations: VN = verbal noun)
```

**Nez Perce** (ISO 639-3: nez, Glottolog: nezp1238)

Word order in Nez Perce is very free. According to Crook (1999: 231-232) any of the logically possible orders of a transitive verb and its A and P arguments is permissible, as shown in the following example:
```
ˀáayàtom   páaqnˀìsaqa          qèiqíine
ˀáayat-um  pee-qnˀíi-see-qa     eqi.it-ne
Woman-ERG  3ON3-dig-INCMPL-PST  qeqiit-OBJ
‘The woman was digging the qeqiit (an edible root).’

Other available word orders:
ˀáayàtom  qèiqíine  páaqnˀìsaqa
  S          O          V

páaqnˀìsaqa  ˀáayàtom  qèiqíine
  V             S        O 

páaqnˀìsaqa  qèiqíine  ˀáayàtom
  V            O         S

qèiqíine  páaqnˀìsaqa  ˀáayàtom
  O         V            S

qèiqíine  ˀáayàtom  páaqnˀìsaqa
  O         S         V
```
Because the available word orders in pragmatically unmarked transitive clauses with full NP arguments include SVO and OVS orders, Nez Perce is coded 1.


**Tagalog** (ISO 639-3: tgl, Glottolog: taga1270)

Tagalog is coded as 0. Though simple main clauses are predicate-initial, one argument can occur before the predicate only if it is accompanied by the predicate marker *ay* (Himmelmann 2005: 357).
```
Ni     lapis   ay   hindi   nagdala     si=Rosa.
even   pencil  PM   NEG     AV.bring    NOM=Rosa
‘Rosa did not bring even a pencil.’ (Schachter & Otanes 1972: 492)

(Abbreviations: AV = actor voice, PM = predicate marker)
```

9. Code ? if the pragmatically unmarked constituent order(s) is not mentioned and cannot be determined by examining examples.

## Examples

**Mangarrayi** (ISO 639-3: mpc, Glottolog: mang1381)

Though Merlan (1989: 26) describes OVS word order as more common, OSV order can also be found in pragmatically marked clauses. This is shown in the example below.
```
0-ḍaway    ̣na-waŋgij 0-ḍad+ma-ñ
N.ABS-tail M.NOM-boy 3SG/3SG-finish-PST.PUNCT
‘The boy finished the tail.’ (Merlan 1989: 26)
```
Mangarrayi is coded 1.


**Nez Perce** (ISO 639-3: nez, Glottolog: nezp1238)

Word order in Nez Perce is very free. According to Crook (1999: 231–232) any of the logically possible orders of a transitive verb and its A and P arguments is permissible, as shown in the following example:
```
ˀáayàtom   páaqnˀìsaqa          qèiqíine

Woman-ERG  3ON3-dig-INCMPL-PST  qeqiit-OBJ
‘The woman was digging the qeqiit (an edible root).’ (Crook 1999: 231)

Other available word orders:
ˀáayàtom  qèiqíine  páaqnˀìsaqa
  S          O          V

páaqnˀìsaqa  ˀáayàtom  qèiqíine

  O         S         V
```
Because the available word orders in pragmatically unmarked transitive clauses with full NP arguments include V-final orders, Nez Perce is coded 1.

**Central Khmer** (ISO 639-3: khm, Glottolog: cent1989)

Haiman (2011: 203) describes the ""standard"" word order of Central Khmer as SV(O). In unmarked transitive clauses with full nominal arguments verbs are therefore followed by objects, as in the example below.
```
krabej         kravi:  kba:l
water.buffalo  shake   head
‘The water buffalo shakes its head.’ (Haiman 2011: 203)
```
Central Khmer is coded 0.

GB134,Is the order of constituents the same in main and subordinate clauses?,"## Is the order of constituents the same in main and subordinate clauses?

## Summary
This feature focuses on whether the basic word order(s) of main clauses are possible in subordinate clauses. A ‘yes’ response for this feature indicates that subjects, verbs, and objects occur in the same order in subordinate clauses as in main clauses. For example, the order between ‘woman’, ‘man’, and ‘chases’ is the same in the simple clause *the woman chases the man* as in the subordinate clause of *I think that the woman chases the man* in English, and this feature asks if it is the same in target languages. In languages with flexible word order it is sufficient for a 1 if all pragmatically unmarked main clause orders are possible in subordinate clauses, even if there are additional word order alternatives in subordinate clauses that are not available in main clauses. Subordinate clauses involving reported speech (e.g. *He said that the woman chases the man.*) should be disregarded.

## Procedure
1. Find the order of core arguments in the language in main clauses, either in the text of the grammar or in simple clause examples involving full NP core arguments.
2. Find the order of core arguments in subordinate clauses, either in the text of the grammar or in examples involving subordinate clauses.
3. If exactly the same basic word orders that are possible in pragmatically unmarked main clauses are also possible in subordinate clauses, code 1.
4. If all of the basic word orders that are possible in pragmatically unmarked main clauses are possible in subordinate clauses, but some additional word orders are also possible in subordinate clauses, code 1.
5. If the grammar states generally that the language has free or flexible word order and examples appear to show the same word order pattern(s) in subordinate clauses as in main clauses, code 1 and include a comment to indicate that coding was based on examples.
6. If the grammar states generally that the language has free or flexible word order and there is insufficient information about subordinate clauses, code ? and provide a comment about the unavailable evidence.

## Examples

**Balantak** (ISO 639-3: blz, Glottolog: bala1315)

Relative clauses are the only clear type of subordination in Balantak. According to van den Berg and Busenitz (2012: 221), ""Verb morphology and word order are the same [for relative clauses] as for main clauses."" This can be seen in the examples below.

*Main Clause*
```
utus-ku      balaki'-na   ning-intoni-mo   lima-ngku  ka' …
sibling-1SG  big-3SG      AV.REAL-hold-PFV hand-1SG   and
‘My older brother shook my hand and …’ (Van den Berg & Busenitz 2012: 219)
```
*Relative Clause*
```
mian    [men  mang-asok     rombia'] …
person  REL   AV.IRR-plant  sago.tree
‘People who plant sago trees …’ (Van den Berg & Busenitz 2012: 222)
```
Balantak is coded 1.

**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

In English the core constituent order in pragmatically unmarked main clauses is SVO, as in *The boy ate the cake*.

The same order is possible in gapped relative clauses, regardless of which constituent is relativized. This is shown in the NPs: *The dog that ate the cake* and *The cake that the dog ate*.

This is sufficient to trigger a 1, regardless of the fact that wh-movement in some English subordinate clauses introduces additional orders (as in *The friend whom I called*). English would be coded 1.

**Batak Karo** (ISO 639-3: btx, Glottolog: bata1293)

In Batak Karo the unmarked order for intransitive clauses is S-V, but in subordinate clauses the opposite order (V-S) is preferred (Woollams 1996: 277). This is demonstrated in the following example, where ‘the hunter went’ occurs first as a main clause, and then as a subordinate clause.
```
(a) é    maka  lawes  perburu  é     nadingken  raja
    and  so    go     hunter   that  ACT.leave  chief
    ‘And so the hunter went, leaving the chief.’ (Woollams 1996: 277)

(b) kenca  perburu  é     lawes  rēh   Simbelang Pinggel
    after  hunter   that  go     come  Simbelang Pinggel
    ‘After the hunter went, along came Simbelang Pinggel.’ (Woollams 1996: 277)
```
Batak Karo is coded 0.

**German** (ISO 639-3: deu, Glottolog: stan1295)

German is an example of a language that changes its word order in subordinate clauses in that the main verb invariably comes at the end in subordinate clauses while in main clauses it may appear as the second constituent. German would be coded 0.

GB135,Do clausal objects usually occur in the same position as nominal objects?,"## Do clausal objects usually occur in the same position as nominal objects?

## Summary
This feature involves a comparison of the word order in transitive clauses with nominal objects with order in clauses with clausal objects. By clausal objects here we mean clauses that are directly governed by a finite verb (typically verbs of ‘wanting’, ‘saying’, etc.). In other words, complement clauses are a specific type of subordinate clauses and are not relative clauses. For example, the objects in _I like **apples**_ (nominal object) and _I like **that you play the piano every morning**_ (clausal object) are in the same position (SVO). Many of the languages that do not place clausal objects in the same position as nominal objects are SOV languages that use SVO order for (long) clausal objects. This question aims to discern whether these clausal objects are treated like prototypical nominal direct objects (not indirect or obliques). This is not always explicitly stated by the descriptive work, but an investigation into the examples and perhaps even appended text of the grammar should typically reveals evidence for answering this question.

## Procedure
1. Find the word order of transitive clauses involving nominal objects (often mentioned explicitly).
2. Find the word order of transitive clauses involving clausal objects (often inferable from examples if not discussed explicitly).
3. Code 1 if clausal objects occur in the same position or same set of possible positions as nominal objects.
4. Code 0 if clausal objects occur in a different position than the pragmatically unmarked position(s) of nominal objects.
5. Code 0 if clausal objects occur in a fixed position while nominal objects can occur in several different positions in a language with relatively free word order.
6. If no information on clausal objects can be found and insufficient examples are provided to determine whether clausal objects occur in the same position(s) as nominal objects, code ? and provide a comment regarding the lack of evidence.

## Examples

**Assiniboine** (ISO 639-3: asb, Glottolog: assi1247)

Assiniboine clausal constituents that serve as the objects of transitive verbs occur before the verb, and may precede or follow the subject, as shown below.
```
(a) John  [mnatkí̜-kte-ší̜         žé]    snok-0-yá
    John  [0-1SG.A-drink-POT-NEG COMP]  know-3SG.A-know
    ‘John knows [that I'm not going to drink it].’ (Cumberland 2005: 415)

(b) [mnatkí̜-kte-ší̜         žé]    John  snok-0-yá
    [0-1SG.A-drink-POT-NEG COMP]  John  know-3SG.A-know
    ‘John knows [that I'm not going to drink it].’ (Cumberland 2005: 415)
```
This matches the SOV and OSV orders that are possible for transitive clauses with intransitive nominal objects.
```
(c) John  tʰápa  žé    a-0-0-pʰá
    John  ball   that  hit-3SG.P-3SG.A-hit
    ‘John hit the ball.’ (Cumberland 2005: 374)

(d) tʰápa  žé    John  a-0-0-pʰá
    ball   that  John  hit-3SG.P-3SG.A-hit
    ‘John hit the ball.’ (Cumberland 2005: 374)
```
Assiniboine is coded 1.


**Djeebbana** (ISO 639-3: djj, Glottolog: djee1236)

Word order is relatively free in Djeebbana, with several unmarked orders possible for nominal objects (McKay 2000: 283–284). However, clausal objects must occur after the main verb, as in the example below.
```
N-bárdbana       nja-rra-bé-na,          nga-mi-Ila                    ka-kkó-ya
3-MIN.M-shallow  1-AUG-REAL-go-DIST.PST  1.MIN.A+3.MIN.O-see-DIST.PST  3.MIN.M-kó-lie
‘We went into shallow water and saw (a dugong (mlirnun)) lying (in the water eating grass).’ (McKay 2000: 311)
```
Because not all main clause orders are possible in complement clauses, Djeebbana is coded 0.


**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

*I like **apples**.* (nominal object) versus *I like **that you play the piano every morning.*** (clausal object) are in the same position (SVO). English is coded 1.

GB136,Is the order of core argument (i.e. S/A/P) constituents fixed?,"## Is the order of core argument (i.e. S, A, and P) constituents fixed?

## Summary
The order of core arguments is fixed if you cannot permute the order of core constituents (S, A, and P) and the verb without either i) changing the propositional content of the clause or ii) requiring intonational signaling or further elements (particles, cleft components, adjuncts).

## Procedure
1. Find the order of core arguments in the language, either in a description of word order patterns or in the examples in the grammar.
2. Determine whether order permutations i) are possible, ii) do not change the propositional content and iii) do not require further elements (particles, cleft components, adjuncts) or intonational signaling.
3. If the three conditions of step 2 are all met, code 0 (order is not fixed).
4. If any of the three conditions of step 2 is not met, code 1 (order is fixed).
5. If no discussion of fixed or free order of core arguments is provided in the grammar and it is unclear whether examples demonstrating word order permutations meet criteria (ii) and (iii) in step 2, code ? and provide a comment regarding the possible orders.

## Examples

**Zuni** (ISO 639-3: zun, Glottolog: zuni1245)

The usual word order in simple Zuni transitive clauses is SOV (Nichols 1997: 6–10). When weak pronouns serve as arguments of the verb they occur to the left of other core constituents, which can result in OSV order.
```
(a) waccita  wihac'ana  'utte-kya
    dog      baby       bite-PST
    ‘The dog bit a baby.’ [*'The baby bit a dog.’] (Nichols 1997: 38)

(b) hom      waccita  'utte-kya
    1SG.ACC  dog      bite-PST
    ‘The dog bit me.’ (Nichols 1997: 38)
```
Though there is a specific order for weak pronominal arguments that differs from the order of full NP arguments, this special weak pronoun order is also fixed. The order of subject, object, and verb thus cannot be permuted freely in Zuni clauses without changing the propositional content of the clause (as shown in the first example above). Zuni is coded 1.

**Bislama** (ISO 639-3: bis, Glottolog: bisl1239)

Bislama is generally a SVO language, as shown in the example below.
```
mi  laekem  yu
1SG like    2SG
‘I like you.’ (Crowley 2004b: 692)
```
Complicating this simple word order pattern is the following description of word order permutation: ""A very important feature of the grammar of Bislama is the fact that noun phrases can be freely moved … to the beginning of the sentence. … There will typically also be a downward shift in intonation at the end of a fronted noun phrase with the rest of the sentence having the normal intonation of a completely new sentence"" (Crowley 2004a: 159).

Because the movement of NP arguments to other positions in the sentence is accompanied by specific intonational signaling, the criteria for non-fixed word order are not met. Bislama is coded 1.

**Bardi** (ISO 639-3: bcj, Glottolog: bard1255)

Many Australian languages, e.g. Bardi (Bowern 2012: 592–594), permute the order of core arguments depending on discourse features. These order differences do not change propositional content and require no further elements. Bardi is an example of a language coded as 0 for this feature.

GB137,Can standard negation be marked clause-finally?,"## Can standard negation be marked clause-finally?

## Summary
This feature refers to standard negation, or the construction(s) that mark negation of (at least) dynamic (i.e. non-stative) verbal predicates in declarative mood. It is possible that the same negation construction will be used for other purposes as well (e.g. with stative or non-verbal predicates), but clauses involving predicates other than the aforementioned dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood should be disregarded. 

The position ‘clause-final’ includes [suffixes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) on verbs in verb-final clauses, even if they are not the very last suffix on the verb. Prefixes on clause-final verbs do not count as clause-final negation. If a negator consists of two obligatory elements and only one is clause-final, this is sufficient to count as clause-final marking and trigger a 1 for this feature. As with other word order features in this dataset, we are concerned with the order of the negative marker when the clause has its canonical intransitive or transitive word order. We are not interested in cases of argument omission or pragmatically marked constructions (e.g. focus); these should be disregarded in coding this feature.

## Procedure
1. Find the section in the available descriptive literature that deals with negation.
2. Consider all the described standard negation constructions (i.e. those that negate dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood).
3. If a negative marker is clause-final in any construction identified in step 2, code 1 for this feature.
4. If there are multiple markers of standard negation and one occurs clause-finally, code 1 for this feature (GB137) (and if the other marker is clause-initial code 1 for [GB138 Can standard negation be marked clause-initially?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB138)).
5. If there is no clause-final marker of clausal negation, code 0.
6. If clause-final markers of clausal negation only occur in pragmatically marked constructions, or with non-verbal or stative predicates, or in non-declarative clauses, code 0.
7. If a marker of standard negation only occurs clause-finally as a result of argument omission (and occurs in a non-final position when independent nominal or pronominal arguments are included), code 0.

## Examples

**Adang** (ISO 639-3: nld, Glottolog: adan1251)

Standard negation in Adang is marked with a negative particle *ʔɛ* and a negative adverb *nɛnɛ*. The latter occurs clause-finally.
```
supi  ʔɛ  na            ʔa-dɛ      nɛnɛ
3PL   NEG thing(=food)  3.OBV-eat  NEG
‘They did not eat food.’ (Haan 2001: 216)

John ʔɛ   sam  don       nɛnɛ
John NEG  go   shopping  NEG
‘John did not go shopping.’ (Haan 2001: 216)
```
Because one of the markers involved in standard negation occurs clause-finally Adang is coded 1.

**Dutch** (ISO 639-3: nld, Glottolog: dutc1256)

The marker of standard negation in Dutch, _niet_ can (but does not always) appear at the end of the clause. This situation triggers a 1 for this feature.

```
hij    kent  Anneke  helemaal niet
3SG.M  know  Anneke  at.all   NEG
‘He doesn't know Anneke at all.’ (Shetter 1984: 146)
```

**Arop-Sissano** (ISO 639-3: aps, Glottolog: arop1242)
The Arop-Sissano negator *elin*/*lin* occurs before the verb in standard clausal negation:
```
yi   lin  tak-lon   tama-n     aij
3SG  NEG  HAB-hear  father-3SG talk
‘He does not listen to his father's talk.’ (Whitacre 1986: 69)

Paul  ro    Linus  elin tor-o   k-am-taw      moyl  olon   olonma  ene
Paul  both  Linus  NEG  HAB-do  PST-MOD-well  work  house  inside  here
‘Both Paul and Linus cannot work well inside this house here.’ (Whitacre 1986: 69)
```
The negator can be repeated in clause-final position, as shown below, but a clause-final negator creates an emphatic (i.e. pragmatically marked) meaning (Whitacre 1986: 69).
```
yi  lin  k-o     save  pene   o      taako  aw-o    yi,  elin!
3SG NEG  PST-do  know  RANGE  thing  a      FUT-do  3SG  NEG
‘He did not think that anything would happen to him, definitely not!’ (Whitacre 1986: 69)
```
The negator can also occur clause-finally in Arop-Sissano when negating non-verbal clauses (Whitacre 1986: 69):
```
po        ene  amon  elin
betelnut  DEI  good  NEG
‘This betelnut is not good.’ (Whitacre 1986: 69)
```
Arop-Sissano is coded 0, as the only constructions that meet the criteria for standard negation (i.e. dynamic verbal predicate and not pragmatically marked) do **not** place the negator in a clause-final position.

**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

Standard negation in English is expressed with the negator *not*, which occurs before the lexical verb (as in, *John did not run,* or *Ann did not hug John.*), meaning its position is not clause-final. There is a contracted form of this negator that can occur clause-finally (as in *John didn't.*). However, this suffix form of the negator occurs on auxiliary verbs and cannot occur clause-finally with a dynamic lexical verb (e.g. * *John eatn't*.) so this affixal negation construction fails to meet the criteria for standard negation. English is coded 0.

## Summary
This feature focuses on standard negation, or the construction(s) that mark negation of (at least) dynamic (i.e. non-stative) verbal predicates in declarative mood. It is possible that the same negation construction will be used for other purposes as well (e.g. with stative or non-verbal predicates), but clauses involving predicates other than the aforementioned dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood should be disregarded.

The position ‘clause-initial’ includes [prefixes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) on clause-initial verbs, even if the negator is not the left-most prefix, but suffixes on clause-initial verbs do not count as clause-initial negation. If the negator consists of two obligatory elements and only one is clause-initial, this is sufficient to count as clause-initial negation and to trigger a 1 for this feature. As with other word order features in this dataset, we are concerned with the order of the negative marker when the clause has its canonical intransitive or transitive word order. We are not interested in cases of argument omission or pragmatically marked constructions (e.g. focus); these should be disregarded in coding this feature.

## Procedure

1. Find the section in the available descriptive literature that deals with negation.
2. Consider all the described standard negation constructions (i.e. those that negate dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood).
3. If the negative marker is clause-initial in any construction identified in step 2, code 1.
4. If there are multiple markers of standard negation and one is clause-initial, code 1 (and if the other is clause final, code 1 for [GB137	Can standard negation be marked clause-finally?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB137) as well).
5. If there is no clause-initial marker of clausal negation, code 0.
6. If clause-initial markers of clausal negation only occur in pragmatically marked constructions, or with non-verbal or stative predicates, or in non-declarative clauses, code 0.
7. If a marker of standard negation only occurs clause-initially as a result of argument omission (and occurs in a non-initial position when independent nominal or pronominal arguments are included), code 0.

## Examples

**Masbatenyo** (ISO 639-3: msb, Glottolog: masb1238)

The negative words used in standard negation in Masbatenyo are placed before the negated predicate (Rosero 2014: 114). As this language has V-initial word order, this results in a standard negation construction whose marker of negation is frequently clause-initial:
```
wará'  na  'ako      nakig'amígo            sa   'íya
NEG    PRT  1SG.ABS  INTR.RECP-make.friend  OBL  3SG.OBL
‘I never made friends with her.’ (Rosero 2014: 61)
```
Masbatenyo is coded 1.


**Bininj Kun-Wok** (ISO 639-3: gup, Glottolog: gunw1252)

Negation is marked by a free-standing particle that occurs before the verb, resulting in clauses where the negator is the first element. This is an example of a 1.

```
Marrek  Birri-ngui-yi
NEG     3AUG/3MIN-eat-IRR
‘They didn't eat it.’ (Evans 2003: 604)
```

**Tamambo** (ISO 639-3: mla, Glottolog: malo1243)

The negator precedes the verb in Tamambo, but follows overt subjects in the standard negation construction:
```
tama-na     ma-te    soara-a
father-3SG  3SG-NEG  see=3SG
‘His father didn't see him.’ (Jauncey 2002: 619)
```
The negator is not in a clause-initial position in the construction that satisfies our definition of standard negation, so Tamambo is coded 0.

## Summary
Is the negative construction for declarative negation (e.g. *I don't drink.*) different from the negative imperative (e.g. *don't drink!*). This feature covers more than only different negators: a different order, loss of finiteness or the addition of new elements also count as differences. If a language-specific analysis indicates two different constructions for negative imperative and prohibitive, then we are only concerned with the construction that negates the traditional imperative function here.

2. Find the section that deals with imperatives.
3. If there is no source that describes negative imperatives (or prohibitives), code ? for this feature.
4. If there are two different negators, code 1.
5. If negative imperatives and declarative constructions contain the same markers, but in a systematically different order, code 1.
6. If negative imperatives contain any other negative elements that are not found in negative declaratives, or if negative imperatives require any other modification (e.g. loss of finiteness), code 1.
7. If negative imperatives and declarative negation constructions are expressed with the same elements in the same general order, code 0.

## Examples
**Finnish** (ISO 639-3: fin, Glottolog: finn1318)

Standard negation in Finnish is expressed with a negative auxiliary followed by the inflectional stem of the main verb. The form of the auxiliary varies according to the person and number of the subject (Karlsson 1999: 69–70).

```
(a) he  lukevat
    3PL read:3PL
    ‘They read.’ (Karlsson 1999: 70)

(b) he  eivät   lue
    3PL NEG.3PL read
    ‘They do not read.’ (Karlsson 1999: 70)
```

The negative imperative contains a different negator, *älä*, which occurs before the imperative affirmative form (Karlsson 1999: 168).

```
(c) lue!
    read
    ‘Read!’ (Karlsson 1999: 168)

(d) älä     lue!
    NEG.IMP read
    ‘Don't read!’ (Karlsson 1999: 168)
```
Finnish is coded as 1 for this feature.

GB140,"Is verbal predication marked by the same negator as all of the following types of predication: locational, existential and nominal?","## Is verbal predication marked by the same negator as all of the following types of predication: locational, existential and nominal?

## Summary
This feature pertains only to the negative marker itself, be it an independent particle, verb, auxiliary, clitic or affix. This feature covers three kinds of non-verbal negation: locational (*The dog is not in the kitchen.*), existential (*Hogwarts does not exist.*) or nominal predication (*Ursula is not a witch.*). 

## Procedure
1. Find the section in the available descriptive literature that deals with negation.
2. Find the sections that describe locational, existential and nominal predication.
3. If at least one of these three has a different negator from verbal negation, code this feature as 0.
4. If you can only find information on one of these three, and it is expressed with the same negator as verbal negation, code as ?.
5. If the source is extensive and only brings up 2 out of 3 of the functions, we can probably safely assume that if the third one was different it would have bene mentioned. Therefore we can code 1. However if the description is minimal, we should code ? because the author could just have missed the third kind of function.
6. If you cannot find information on any of these three categories of non-verbal negation, code as ?.

## Examples
**Turkish** (ISO 639-3: tur, Glottolog: nucl1301) 

Standard negation in Turkish is marked by the suffix _-mA_ (a). Copula sentences, including locational (b) and nominal predication (c), have a special negative auxiliary *deǧil* that inflects for tense and person/number (Kornfilt 1997: 123–124). Turkish is coded as 0 for this feature.

```
a.  Hasan kitab-ı   oku-ma-dı
    Hasan book-ACC  read-NEG-PST
    ‘Hasan didn't read the book.’ (Kornfilt 1997: 123)

b.  (ben) ev-de    deǧil-im
    I     home-LOC NEG.COP-1SG
    ‘I am not at home.’ (Kornfilt 1997: 124)

c.  (ben) hasta deǧil-im
    I     sick  NEG.COP-1SG
    ‘I am not sick.’ (Kornfilt 1997: 124)

GB146,Is there a morpho-syntactic distinction between predicates expressing controlled versus uncontrolled events or states?,"## Is there a morphosyntactic distinction between predicates expressing controlled versus uncontrolled events or states?

## Summary

In a number of languages, predicates referring to uncontrolled events or states happening to animate participants are encoded differently from those that refer to controlled events. Often, such a distinction surfaces in predicates referring to sensations (such as hunger, thirst, pain, cold, cramps, sleepiness, etc.), emotions (anger, happiness), or cognitive states (forgetting, remembering). These uncontrolled predicates may be found in specialized constructions, including different case frames (‘sleep hits me’), special conjugation classes of verbs or adjectives, dedicated (modal) markers for control vs. non-control, etc. Other terms that may be used in the literature are non-volitional, non-agentive, non-volitive or involuntary. Note that we are not interested in how stative events with *inanimate* experiencers are coded: their coding is irrelevant, whether they show distinctions with controlled events or states or not. The existence of verbal derivations such as passive or causative does not count here. At least three different predicates should show a special kind of construction to code 1 for this feature.

## Procedure

1. Check sections in a grammar on case marking, argument marking in general, simple clauses, verbal morphology, and look for expressions of hunger, thirst, pain, sickness, vomiting, cold, cramps, sleepiness, anger and happiness.
2. Code 1 if you find at least three examples of non-controlled experiences coded with a specialized construction that is different from the typical way to express (controlled) events or states.
3. Code 0 if an author explicitly mentions that such constructions do not exist in the language (e.g. they did not find any although they were expected to occur because they are found in neighboring languages).
4. Code 0 if you find examples of uncontrolled events or states that are expressed like any other (controlled) event or state, but less than three examples of uncontrolled events or states that are coded in a standard way.
5. Code ? if nothing is said on the topic and there is not enough data to know whether such constructions exist or not.

## Examples

**Siwai** (ISO 639-3: siw, Glottolog: siwa1245)

Siwai is coded 1 for this feature.

Siwai has a lexical split in its alignment system. Intransitive-only verbs can be classified according to the kind of suffixal index they take. There are verbs that take so-called ‘SO’ suffixes, which are made up of an O index + _-u_. In other words, the single argument of SO-verbs is coded the same as a patient in transitive verbs. In another class of intransitive verbs, which take ‘SA’ suffixes, the single argument is coded the same as an agent in transitive verbs (Onishi 1994: 398, 401–403). This means that experiencers, which have no control over the events that happen to them, are coded differently from agents, which do have control over the action that is performed.

```
Examples of SO-verbs (uncontrolled states)

haa- ‘to want, to agree’
hunok- ‘to become/be full in stomach’
kamann- ‘to feel cold’
kipi'tak ‘to hiccup’

nii   tuu    haa-mu-u-ng
I     water  want-1SO-PROX.PAST-M
‘I want water’ (Onishi 1994: 401–402)
```

```
Examples of SA-verbs (controlled actions)

kumar- ‘to laugh’
mon- ‘to look’
pu'j- ‘to shout’
konn- ‘to walk’
nok- ‘to say’

(Onishi 1994: 403)
```

**Nuu-chah-nulth** (ISO 639-3: nuk, Glottolog: nuuc1236)

Nuu-chah-nulth has a specialized future tense clitic _ʔaːqtɬ_, called ‘intentive’ by Davidson (2002: 305), that implies that the agent of an action has control over the event. Nuu-Chah-nulth is coded 1.

```
ts'axʷ-ʃitɬ=ʔaːqtɬ=qa'=s
spear-PFV=INTENT=SUBR=1SG
‘And I am going to spear him.’ (Davidson 2002: 305)
```

**Khwarshi-Inkhoqwari** (ISO 639-3: khv, Glottolog: khva1239)

In Khwarshi-Inkhoqwari there is an ‘accidental’ marker for verbs, *-l*, that indicates that an action is not voluntary and not controlled. Involuntary agents are marked with the contessive case. The verb _puɬ-a_‘to blow’, for example, can be coded as an uncontrolled state _puɬ**-l-**a_ (Khalilova 2009: 267). Kwarshi-Inkhoqwari is coded 1.

GB147,Is there a morphological passive marked on the lexical verb?,"## Is there a morphological passive marked on the lexical verb?

## Summary

Passivization is a detransitivizing operation that takes a transitive clause (*The dog bites the man.*) and turns it into an intransitive clause by promoting the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the man*) to morphosyntactic [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) function. In the resulting intransitive clause, the former [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the dog*) either vanishes or adopts an oblique function: *The man is bitten (by the dog).* ‘Mediopassives’, ‘anticausatives’ and the sort (e.g. ‘x breaks the vase’ > ‘the vase breaks’) also count as passives. This question targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) passive markers on lexical verbs. Anything that happens with auxiliaries is irrelevant here.

Sometimes a language uses a combination of an auxiliary and a special form of the verb to express passive clauses. This verb form may be called a 'participle' or 'infinitive'. If such participial or infinitival forms are morphologically marked (that is, they are not unmarked/zero-marked), they also trigger a 1 for this feature.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions a phonologically bound morpheme that marks passive clauses. 
2. Code 1 if there is no information on phonological (in)dependence but the relevant passivizing marker (auxiliary or particle) is orthographically bound to the verb. Add a comment that your analysis is based on orthography here.
3. Code 1 if you identify a phonologically bound passive marker in the examples/texts provided in a source. Investigate sections on verb morphology, valency change and argument structure.
4. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no passive.  
5. Code 0 if a source mentions a phonologically free passive marker or other means of passivization, but none that are phonologically bound to the verb
6. Code 0 if a grammar treats other valency changing operations in considerable depth but does not mention passive constructions.
7. Code ? if there are examples that contain a potential passivizing construction but their analysis remains inconclusive.
8. Code ? if there are no sources treating valency changing operations in the language or if treatment of them is very limited.

## Examples

**Udihe** (ISO 639-3: ude, Glottolog: udih1248) 

Udihe has a morphological passive, which is formed with the suffix *-u*. Udihe is coded 1 for this feature.

```
si      min-du   gida-si-u-zeŋe-i
you     me-DAT   spear-V-PASS-FUT-2SG
‘You will be killed by me.’ (Nikolaeva & Tolskaya 2001: 572–582)
```

**Jamaican Creole English** (ISO 639-3: jam, Glottolog: jama1262) 

Passives in Jamaican Creole English are formed with the particle *get*. Jamaican Creole English is coded 0 for this feature.

```
Op   tu   nou   dem   no     nuo    ou   di    fuud    get     kuk.

‘Even now they still don't know how the food was cooked.’ (Farquharson 2013: 86)
```

**Bongili** (ISO 639-3: bui, Glottolog: bong1284) 

According to Mangulu (2008), Bongili only forms passives by means of a word order change. 
>""Le passif est rendu ... par l'antéposition du patient avec ou sans pronominalisation redondante..."" (Mangulu 2008: 30). 

Bongili is coded 0 for this feature.

```
a. Active:
   ɓa-bom-ák-á            moto   yáná
   3PL-kill-PST-DIST.PST  man    yesterday
   ‘They killed a man yesterday.’ (Mangulu 2008: 30)

b. Passive:
   moto    ɓa-bom-ák-á            yáná
   man     3PL-kill-PST-DIST.PST  yesterday
   ‘A man was killed yesterday.’ (Mangulu 2008: 30)
```

**Kuku-Uwanh** (ISO 639-3: uwa, Glottolog: kuku1280) 

For Kuku-Uwanh, authors Smith & Johnson (2000) explicitly mention that there is no passive or antipassive construction: 

> ""Nganhcara lacks passive or antipassive constructions. Free word order and the optional omission of constituents allows Nganhcara to achieve the discourse functions of these formations without morphological apparatus"" (Smith & Johnson 2000: 425). 

It is coded 0.

## Summary

An antipassive marker detransitivizes verbs by removing the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument or realizing it as an oblique argument. In a construction with ergative alignment, this means that the [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument of a transitive clause is encoded as the [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument in a corresponding antipassive clause. An antipassive marker often also has other detransitivizing functions, such as reflexivization, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative.  In practice, this feature targets any intransitivising marker that is not, or not only, a reflexive, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative marker. This question targets productive [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) antipassive markers on lexical verbs, as well as reduplication. Zero-marking or the removal of a transitivizing marker is not sufficient for a 1. Anything that happens with auxiliaries is irrelevant here. If the antipassive marker is only applied in a limited set of probably lexicalized items, it does not trigger 1.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions a phonologically bound morpheme to mark antipassive clauses.
2. Code 1 if there is no information on phonological (in)dependence but the relevant antipassive marker is orthographically bound to the verb. Add a comment that your analysis is based on orthography.
3. Code 1 if you identify a phonologically bound antipassive marker in the examples/texts provided in a source.
4. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no antipassive.
5. Code 0 if a source mentions a phonologically free antipassive marker or other means of marking antipassives, but not one that is phonologically bound to the verb
6. Code 0 if a grammar treats other valency changing operations in considerable depth but does not mention antipassive constructions.
7. Code ? if there are examples that contain a potential antipassive construction but their analysis remains inconclusive.
8. Code ? if there are no sources treating valency changing operations in the language or if treatment of them is very limited.		

## Examples

**Kuku Yalanji** (ISO 639-3: gvn, Glottolog: kuku1273)

Kuku Yalanji has ergative alignment of case marking on nouns. It also has an antipassive suffix, *-ji*. In the active clause below, the A argument (‘the man’) is marked with ergative case. In the antipassive clause, it is coded with absolutive case, like an S argument. The former absolutive argument (P) is coded as a location in the antipassive clause. Kuku Yalanji is coded 1. 

Note that the alignment pattern of case marking is accusative for pronouns, so non-pronominal A arguments are marked with ergative case, while pronominal A arguments are marked with nominative case.

```
a. Active clause:
   nyulu      dingkar-angka    minya        nuka-ny
   3SG.NOM(A) man-ERG:PT(A)    meat.ABS(P)  eat-PST
   ‘The man ate meat.’ (Patz 2002: 152)

b. Antipassive clause:
   nyulu       dingkar      minya-nga    nuka-ji-ny
   3SG.NOM(S)  man.ABS(S)   meat-LOC     eat-ANTIP-PST
   ‘The man had a good feed of meat (he wasted nothing.)’ (Patz 2002: 152)

(Abbreviations: PT potent case)
```

At the same time, the antipassive marker in Kuku Yalanji exemplifies how such markers often also fulfill other detransitivizing functions in languages such as passivization.

```
c. Passive clause:
   warru             (yaburr-undu)   bayka-ji-ny
   young.man.ABS(S)  (shark-LOC:PT)  bite-PASS-PST
   ‘The young man was bitten (by a shark).’ (Patz 2002: 148)

(Abbreviations: PT potent case)
```

**Cilubà** (ISO 639-3: abc, Glottolog: luba1249)

Cilubà is an example of a language with an antipassive marker, *-angan*, but without ergative flagging or indexing alignment. One could call the language predominantly accusative, since that is the alignment of the indexes on verbs. The typical function of the antipassive in Cilubà is to indicate a non-punctual action (e.g. a custom or habit) by which a non-identifiable patient is affected. Or by which various patients, the identity of which is not immediately relevant in the discourse situation, are affected (Dom, Bostoen & Segerer 2015). Cilubà is coded 1.

```
a. Active:
   Mùsàlaayì    udi     ùlua          mulwishì
   CL1:soldier  CL1:PRS CL1:fight:FV  CL1:enemy
   ‘The soldier who is fighting the enemy.’ (Dom et al. 2015: 355)

b. Antipassive:
   Mùsàlaayì     ydi      ùlu-angan-a         mu         cialu              cìà      mvità
   CL1:soldier   CL1:PRS  CL1:fight-ANTIP-FV  LOC.CL18   CL7:meeting.place  CL7:CON  CL:war
   ‘The soldier who is fighting (someone) on the battlefield…’ (Dom et al. 2015: 355)

(Abbreviations: CL nominal class, FV final vowel, CON connective)

GB149,Is there a morphologically marked inverse on verbs?,"## Is there a morphologically marked inverse on verbs?

## Summary

Inverse systems are based on an animacy, person, or topicality hierarchy. Inverse markers indicate that the patient outranks the agent on the hierarchy. In a system that has a hierarchy [speech act participants > 3SG pronouns > humans > animals, etc.], for example, ‘man INV-bite dog’ would mean ‘the dog bit the man’. Note that in some languages, there are portmanteau morphemes that both function as person [indexes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) on verbs and as direct/inverse markers. They would trigger 1 for this question. This feature targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) inverse markers.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if the grammar discusses a marker on the verb that encodes that the patient outranks the agent on an animacy or person hierarchy. Be sure to consult sections dealing with argument marking, verbal derivation and verbal morphology in general. Sometimes authors do not explicitly discuss the function of these markers or they do not present a hierarchy, but they may present a paradigm from which you can figure out the pattern.
2. Code 1 if different indexes are used according to whether the patient outranks the agent on an animacy or person hierarchy or the reverse is true.
3. Code 0 if there are no signs of such a system in the language.

## Examples

**Panare** (ISO 639-3: pbh, Glottolog: enap1235)

Panare is coded 1.

In Panare (Payne & Payne 2013: 24-25), the inverse marker *y-* only occurs in past-perfective verbs. It indicates that the patient of a clause outranks the agent of the clause on the following topicality hierarchy: 1SG/2 > 3/1PL. It also seems to be used when both the agent and patient are third person.

```
Kën        a-y-ïkïtï-yaj
ANIM.INVIS 2SG-INV-cut-PST.PFV
‘He/she cut you.’ (Payne & Payne 2013: 25)
```

**Cherokee** (ISO 639-3: chr, Glottolog: cher1273)

In Cherokee, there are two sets of prefixes, a ‘direct’ one and an ‘inverse’ one. In addition to marking direct or inverse, each prefix also indexes the most animate participant (indicating its person and number). Cherokee is coded 1.

```
a. Direct
   anii-kééhya  sookwili   tee-anii-ahyvthéeɁa 
   3A-woman     horse      DISTR-DIRC.3PL-kick:PRS 
   ‘The women are kicking the horses.’ (Montgomery-Anderson 2008: 197 following Scancarelli 1987: 128)

b. Inverse
   sookwili    kaa-uunii-ahyvthéeɁa    anii-kééhya 
   horse       ANIM-INV.3PL-kick:PRS   3A-woman 
   ‘The horses are kicking the women.’ (Montgomery-Anderson 2008: 197 following Scancarelli 1987: 128)
```

GB150,Is there clause chaining?,"## Is there clause chaining?

## Summary
Clause-chaining involves sequences of medial clauses (i.e. formally reduced or restricted clauses that do not have the full marking that usually occurs on the verb) which are dependent on a single, fully inflected verb that often (but not always) occurs in final clause. Clause chains may also be referred to as topic chains or as sequences of medial clauses/medial verbs. Crucially, this construction involves a single clause with a full, unrestricted, finite verb form and medial clauses that are dependent on it for specification of inflectional categories (e.g. TAM). 

Clause chains are often used to describe sequences of events, and the medial verbs involved may be marked by [special affixes to indicate temporal relationships](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB152). Clause chains may also include markers of [switch reference](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB151). Medial verbs in some languages may be marked in the usual way for person/number of their arguments, though they generally lack some other canonical verbal inflection or involve specific marked verb forms that cannot be used in freestanding clauses. 

There is considerable debate regarding the syntax of clause chaining generally and within individual languages. This construction is not merely a series of juxtaposed minimal clauses, as it requires dependency on one fully specified clause for full interpretation. It is also not straightforwardly a series of subordinated clauses (as in the series of temporal adjuncts in English, *Before he ate, while he was cooking the soup, he added salt.*). The syntactic relationship between clauses in clause chains is often described as a special type of coordination or a form of cosubordination.

In some cases clause-chaining may be difficult to distinguish from [serial verb constructions](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118). Remember that a serial verb construction involves a set of verbs or verb phrases that function as a single predicate, whereas clause-chaining involves a set of *clauses* with formally reduced verbs, all dependent on a single fully specified verb form. Clause-chaining is also different from [verb compounding](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) in that the clauses in clause chaining are [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) and express separate propositions, which is not the case for verb compounding. In cases where it is unclear which of these constructions is represented by the examples in the grammar, a ? may be coded, but be sure to indicate in the comments that you were unable to determine which of these constructions is demonstrated in the relevant examples.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if the language can express a sequence of events through a series of clauses with morphologically reduced verb forms that are dependent on a single, fully-specified verb form (which typically occurs in the final clause).
2. Code 0 if the language can express a sequence of events through a set of verbs or verb phrases, but these verbs are each fully inflected (i.e. there are not reduced verb forms that depend on a single fully-inflected form for specification of required grammatical categories).
3. Code 0 and consider [GB118](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118) if the language has constructions involving a sequence of verbs, but the sequence of verb forms always functions as a single predicate rather than a series of clauses.
4. Code 0 and see [GB122](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) if the language has a construction that involves multiple verbs in sequence, but these verbs appear to function as a phonological and grammatical word, and/or describe a single event rather than separate propositions.
5. If you are uncertain whether a construction involving a series of clauses is clause chaining or instead a sequence of subordinated clauses, either open an issue to discuss the data or code ? and provide a comment.
6. If you are uncertain whether there is a construction that meets the criteria above for clause-chaining or whether all examples involving series of verbs exemplify another construction (e.g. serial verbs or verb compounding), code ? and provide a comment.

## Examples

**Northern Paiute** (ISO 639-3: pao, Glottolog: nort2954)

In Northern Paiute, clauses that contain sequential or simultaneous markers cannot stand independently. These are used in a clause-chaining construction, dependent on a normally inflected clause in the chain for full temporal interpretation. 

```
a. Yaisi  o=woetsimmi-na,    yaisi  o=ggwɨdzɨ-na,     o=ddza-puni-hu-dzaga-ti
   PRT    3SG.ACC=watch-SIM  PRT    3SG.ACC=stir-SIM  3SG.ACC=INS.fingers-see-PFV-MOT-TNS
   ‘While you are watching it, while you are stirring it, you look at it every once in a while.’ (Toosarvandani 2016: 851)

b. Yaisi  mɨ=toogɨ=tɨwau  nobiya-u-si,  mɨ=toogi=tɨwau  tsa-hibi-kɨ-u-ga-si,          tammi         mia-ga-kwɨ  mii
   PRT    PL=dog=also     pack-PFV-SEQ  PL=dog=also     INSTR.fingers-drink-APPL-PFV  1PL.INCL.NOM  go-MOT-IRR  QUOT
   ‘So then, having packed up the dogs, and having made sure those dogs get a drink, so we’d take off.’ (Toosarvandani 2016: 851)

(Abbreviations: PRT discourse particle, SIM simultaneous, SEQ sequential, MOT motion suffix, TNS general tense)
```
However, this clause-chaining construction differs markedly from the normal subordination construction in Northern Paiute, which involves nominalization and cannot involve the simultaneous or sequential markers.

```
c. subordinate clause, with the nominalizer -na
   Isu      sɨadamɨ  i=bisabi-na        wadzi-mia-hu
   DEM.NOM  girl     1SG.GEN=like-NMLZ  hide-go-PFV
   ‘The girl that I like ran away.’ (Toosarvandani 2016: 854)

d. subordinate clause, with the sequential marker -si
   *Isu      sɨadamɨ  i=bisabi-si       wadzi-mia-hu
   DEM.NOM  girl     1SG.GEN=like-SEQ  hide-go-PFV
   (Toosarvandani 2016: 854)
```
Northern Paiute’s clause-chaining involves formally restricted clauses in sequence that depend on a single clause for full interpretation and do not employ the strategy that is typically associated with subordination in the language. This meets the criteria for a 1 code.

**Kumyk** (ISO 639-3: kum, Glottolog: kumy1244)

```
bu-lar,  köl-nü   gör-üp,
this-PL  lake-ACC see-CVB

araba-syn    toqtat-yp,

‘They see the lake, stop their cart, make Manaj bring the suitcase, 
go to the bank of the lake, open the suitcase, take out the bottles, 
put them in a row, fill them with water, 
and put them back in the suitcase.’ (Džanmavov 1967:234)
```
Kumyk marks medial clauses with the CVB suffix _-yp_ (or variant _-üp_). Each of the predicates marked with this suffix lack tense marking, and are interpreted with the tense category marked on the final verb. This language expresses a sequence of events with a series of reduced clauses that are dependent on the grammatical features specified in a single fully inflected clause for interpretation. Kumyk is coded 1.

GB151,"Is there an overt verb marker dedicated to signalling coreference or noncoreference between the subject of one clause and an argument of an adjacent clause (""switch reference"")?","## Is there an overt verb marker dedicated to signaling coreference or noncoreference between the subject of one clause and an argument of an adjacent clause (‘switch reference’)?

## Summary
Is there an overt marker [on the verb](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27) that marks whether the argument has the same/a different referent as/than an argument of the following clause? Some languages (e.g. Kashaya) signal switch reference by using different allomorphs of TAM markers depending on whether the subject of the following clause is the same or different. Some systems (e.g. Southeastern Pomo) only have special morphology to indicate different subjects, whereas the contrasting morphological pattern that is used for coreferential subjects can also be used for some combinations of clauses with different referents.

## Procedure
1. Examine sections of the grammar that describe clause combining and multi-clausal constructions, or examine examples of multi-clausal constructions if the grammar does not explicitly designate sections to describe multi-clausal constructions.
2. Code 1 if there is a marker or morphological alternation in the verbal domain that signals whether the subject of a clause has the same or a different referent as/than an argument (usually the subject) of an adjacent clause.
3. Code 1 if there is a marker that signals (non-)coreference between an argument of a clause and an argument of an adjacent clause, with the opposite unmarked (e.g. non-coreference marked overtly and coreference unmarked).
4. Code 0 if there are no morphological alternations associated with coreference of arguments in adjacent clauses.

## Examples

**Washo** (ISO 639-3: was, Glottolog: wash1253)

No switch of reference:

```
yaŋáhadik'ɨli            gúɁšemiɁé:setiɁaɁ
they.ran.back.and.forth  they.stopped.making.noise
‘They ran back and forth and stopped making noise.’ (Jacobsen 1967: 247)
```

Switch of reference:

```
mémluyi-š     lémehi
if.you.eat-SR I’ll.drink
‘If you eat, I’ll drink.’ (Jacobsen 1967: 247)

(Abbreviations: SR switch in reference)
```

Washo would be coded 1 because it uses a *-š* suffix on the verb to mark a switch in reference in the following clause.

**Kashaya** (ISO 639-3: kju, Glottolog: kash1280)

Kashaya has markers of co-reference and non-co-reference of subjects that can be used to track referents across clauses. Kashaya is coded 1.

```
a. tubič-ba   waːduʔ
   stand-CoR  walk
   ‘I got up and left.’/‘I left after getting up.’ (Gamon 1997: 256)

b. Ɂa     tui-li    mukin     soh   čaw
   1SG.A  stand-SR  3.M.SG.A  just  sit
   ‘I stood up but he just sat there.’ (Gamon 1997: 256)

(Abbreviations: CoR coreferential)
```

**Southeastern Pomo** (ISO 639-3: pom, Glottolog: sout2982)

Southeastern Pomo uses markers on the verb to signal sequential actions in sentences comprised of multiple clauses. A general form of the sequential action marker can be used whether or not the subject of the first clause is the same as the second clause, according to Moshinsky (1974: 76).

```
a. Ɂa  x̣ol-o-fla         qnak'-ya
   1SG hither-travel-SEQ fall.asleep-PFV
   ‘He fell asleep after I came.’ (Moshinsky 1974: 76)

b. yiwi yoq-fla   bxe  ṭlaq-ya
   3SG  shoot-SEQ deer fall.over-PFV
   ‘After he shot it, the deer fell over.’ (Moshinsky 1974: 76)
```

A different sequential marker is also available, which specifies that the clauses have different subjects.

```
c. Ɂa  x̣ol-o-yukin           tu       qnak'-in-ya
   1SG hither-travel-SEQ.SR  already  fall.asleep-?-PFV
   ‘He fell asleep before I came.’ (Moshinsky 1974: 76)

d. ma   moc'ki-yukin    Ɂa  til-o-di-t
   2SG  wake.up-SEQ.SR  1SG thither-travel-POT-IPFV
   ‘I’ll go before you wake up.’ (Moshinsky 1974: 76)
``` 

Southeastern Pomo would be coded 1. Although the general sequential marker can be used whether or not there is a switch in the referent of the subject across two clauses, there is an allomorph of the sequential action marker that is dedicated to marking a switch in the referent of the subject across adjacent clauses.

GB152,Is there a morphologically marked distinction between simultaneous and sequential clauses?,"## Is there a morphologically marked distinction between simultaneous and sequential clauses?

## Summary
This question is concerned with whether there is an overt marker dedicated to signaling the distinction between temporally simultaneous and sequential actions. If sequential meaning is a secondary function of an imperfective aspect this does not count; it must be indicated by a devoted marker. The language does not need to express both sequential and simultaneous temporal relationships overtly; one marker devoted to either function is sufficient to trigger a 1.

## Procedure
1. If there is a marker on the verb that indicates that the event described in an adjacent clause is temporally simultaneous with the marked clause, code 1.
2. If there is a marker on the verb that indicates that the event described in an adjacent clause is temporally sequential with the marked clause, code 1.
3. If clauses or verbs are combined in a way (e.g. through subordination) that implies sequential or simultaneous action and no overt verb marker is dedicated to this distinction, code 0.
4. If simultaneous or sequential temporal relationships are implied through the use of imperfective aspect or adverbial elements other than a dedicated verbal marker, code 0.		

## Examples

**Southeastern Pomo** (ISO 639-3: pom, Glottolog: sout2982)

Southeastern Pomo uses different markers on the verb to signal whether the action expressed by the following verb form happened in sequence with the action of the first verb, or simultaneous with the first verb.
 
Simultaneous: *-day*
```
a. yiwi Ɂa   sca-day         sma-n  q'lal-ya  
   3SG  1SG  be.there-SIM    sleep  get-PFV
   ‘He fell asleep while I was there.’ (Moshinsky 1974: 76)  

b. Ɂa  wit     xbac'-day  x̣ol-o-di-t  
   1SG 1SG.OBJ ask-SIM    hither-travel-POT-IPFV  
   ‘I’ll come when he asks me.’ (Moshinsky 1974: 76)  
```

Sequential: *-fla*
```
c. Ɂa    x̣ol-o-fla         qnak'-ya  
   1SG   hither-travel-SEQ fall.asleep-PFV
   ‘He fell asleep after I came.’ 

d. yiwi  yoq-fla   bxe  ṭlaq-ya  
   3SG   shoot-SEQ deer fall.over-PFV
   ‘After he shot it, the deer fell over.’ (Moshinsky 1974: 76)  
```

Southeastern Pomo would be coded 1 because the temporal relationship between sequential events is marked by a suffix on the verb. There is also a marker on the verb to indicate simultaneous events. However, this language would still be coded 1 if only one of these temporal relationship markers existed.

## Summary

A causative is a valency increasing operation that introduces a causer core argument that makes a non-subject argument do or become something (e.g. ‘x eats’ -> ‘y feeds x’ = ‘y causes x to to eat’). Note that both causatives adding an argument to a transitive clause (*I drink milk* -> *x causes me to drink milk*) and those adding an argument to an intransitive clause (*I sit* -> *x causes me to sit*) are targeted by this question. This question targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) causative markers. Lexicalized causative verbs should be disregarded for this feature.

1. Code 1 if a source mentions a phonologically bound morpheme that marks causatives.
2. Code 1 if there is no information on phonological (in)dependence but the relevant causative marker is orthographically bound to the verb. Add a comment that your analysis is based on orthography here.
3. Code 1 if you identify a phonologically bound causative marker in the examples/texts provided in a source.
4. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no causative.  
5. Code 0 if a source mentions a periphrastic or phonologically independent causative construction, but not one marked with a bound marker.  
6. Code 0 if a grammar treats other valency changing operations in considerable depth but does not mention causative constructions.
7. Code ? if there are examples that contain a potential causative construction but their analysis remains inconclusive.  
8. Code ? if there are no sources treating valency changing operations in the language or if treatment of them is very limited.  

## Examples

**Ao Naga** (ISO 639-3: njo, Glottolog: aona1235)

Ao Naga (or Chungli Ao, in the source) has a causative suffix, *-taktsɨ*, which can transitivize intransitive sentences, as well as add an additional role to an already transitive clause. Ao Naga is coded 1 for this feature.

```
a. (Intransitive > transitive)
   ni-i   la      tʃip-taktsɨ
   1SG-A  3SG.F   cry-CAUS
   ‘I made her cry.’ (Escamilla 2012: 55)

b. (Transitive > ditransitive)
   pa-i      la-nem      mapa   injak-takstsɨ
   3SG.M-A   3SG.F-nem   chore  do/work-CAUS
   ‘He made her do work.’ (Escamilla 2012: 55)
```

**Barain** (ISO 639-3: bva, Glottolog: bare1279)

Like other Chadic languages, Barain has fossilized remains of a system of intransitive-causative vowel alternation, which is no longer productive (Lovestrand 2012: 126–127). There is no other transitivizing morphology (although there is a passive, reflexive and reciprocal). Barain is coded as 0.

GB156,Is there a causative construction involving an element that is unmistakably grammaticalized from a verb for 'to say'?,"## Is there a causative construction involving an element that is unmistakably grammaticalized from a verb for ‘to say’?

## Summary

A causative is a valency increasing operation that introduces a causer subject that makes a non-subject argument do or become something (e.g. ‘x eats’ -> ‘y feeds x’ = ‘y causes x to to eat’). Both causatives adding an argument to a transitive clause (*I drink milk* -> *x causes me to drink milk*) and those adding an argument to an intransitive clause (*I sit -> x causes me to sit*) are included in this feature. This question targets causative constructions with an element that clearly originated as a verb for ‘to say’ (e.g. *I said for the stone to fall* to mean ‘I made the stone fall’). Various verbs of saying count for this feature, including ‘to say’, ‘to speak’ and ‘to call’. If another verb is involved that cannot be easily translated as ‘to say’, e.g. ‘ask’, code 0 but mention the verb in the comments.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions a causative construction that features an element that originates as a verb for ‘to say’.
2. Code 1 if you spot an unambiguous causative construction that features an element that otherwise means ‘to say’ (e.g. where the causee is an inanimate entity).
3. Code 0 if there is a causative construction with an element that otherwise occurs as a verb that cannot be translated as ‘to say’. Mention the verb in the comments.
3. Code 0 if causative constructions are comprehensively discussed, but nothing is said about a causative construction featuring a ‘say’ element.
4. Code 0 if there are no causative constructions.
5. Code ? if you spot potential causative constructions featuring a ‘say’ element, but the analysis is inconclusive.
6. Code ? if there are no sources treating causatives or other valency changing operations in the language or if treatment of them is very limited.

## Examples

**Amkoe** (ISO 639-3: huc, Glottolog: hoaa1235)

Amkoe has a bound causative prefix *kí-*, that is very similar to the verb for *kíí* ‘say’ (Collins & Gruber 2014: 165). Amkoe is coded 1 in Grambank.

```
ǎ""ri   yà   xà  'a     kí-|'í    yȁ
what   Q    QF  PROG   CAUS-cry  3SG
‘What is making him/her cry?’ (Collins & Gruber 2014: 165)
```

**Nukna** (ISO 639-3: klt, Glottolog: nukn1238)

Nukna usually expresses causative meaning through clause chaining. The verb *me* ‘say’ is one of the main verbs that is used in such clause chains. In the following examples, the meaning of *me* is clearly causative. Nukna is coded 1 for this feature.

```
a. ko     me-tá            umi=yá     tárikngi-ine-k
   2SG.A  speak-2SG.DS.SEQ water=A    become.dry-FUT-3SG
   ‘You say (something that causes) the water (to) become dry.’

b. ámna    yáin-lá=yá         me-t                 ámnanáráwa=yá  yáup   tá-u-ráng
   man     head-3SG.POSS=A    speak-2/3PL.DS.SEQ   people=A       work   do-PST-2/3PL
   ‘The head men said (something that caused) the people (to) do the work.’

(Taylor 2015: 130)
```

**Mandarin Chinese** (ISO 639-3: cmn, Glottolog: mand1415)

Mandarin Chinese has a causative construction with the verb *jiào* ‘to call’. This construction triggers a 1 for this feature in Grambank.

``` 
a. Zhè  jiào  wǒ  dānxīn.
   this call  1SG worried
   ‘This makes me worried.’ (Jingting Ye, p.c. 26-11-2020)

b. Tā    jiào   xiǎomíng  míngtiān  lái  dǎpái.
   3SG   call   Xiaoming  tomorrow  come play.
   ‘He made Xiaoming to come tomorrow and play cards.’ 
   (Context: the 3SG agent is Xiaoming’s noisy roommate,
   who is so loud that he ‘made’ Xiaoming escape 
   to a friend’s house where he will play cards.) (Jingting Ye, p.c. 26-11-2020)

c. Tā  jiào  wǒ  chī zhè  gè dàngāo.
   3SG call  1SG eat this CL cake
   ‘He/she makes me eat this cake.’ (Jingting Ye, p.c. 26-11-2020)

## Summary

A verb is reduplicated if its root is fully or partially repeated. The word class of the outcome of the process is not relevant, as long as the root is a verb. Full repetition of already inflected verbs or units larger than a root does not trigger a 1 for this feature. This feature only targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) reduplication. Reduplication in closed classes (e.g. only a small, closed conjugation class) is not relevant. Lexicalized examples are irrelevant.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions productive verbal reduplication.
2. Code 1 if you identify productively reduplicated verbs in a source.
3. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no productive (verbal) reduplication.
4. Code 0 if a source discusses reduplication of nouns or other items but not of verbs.
5. Code 0 if the only instances of verbal reduplication are lexicalized.
6. Code ? if there are examples that contain potential verbal reduplication but their analysis remains inconclusive. 
7. Code ? if you suspect the author may have missed or disregarded verbal reduplication.

## Examples

**Leti** (ISO 693-3: lti, Glottolog: leti1246)

In Leti, instrument nouns can be productively derived from nouns by means of partial reduplication (van Engelenhoven 2004: 101–102, 139–140). Leti is coded 1.

```
sòra ‘to sew’       → sòr-sòra ‘needle’
sèra ‘to sprout’    → sèr-sèra ‘sprinkler’
sòpna ‘order’       → sòp-sòpna ‘servant’
```

**Abu' Arapesh** (ISO 639-3: aah, Glottolog: abua1245)

In Abu' Arapesh, repetition and reduplication are only productive in child language (Nekitel 1985: 174). This language is coded 0.
	
**Yulu** (ISO 639-3: yul, Glottolog: yulu1243)

For Yulu, Santandrea (1970: 79) explicitly mentions that reduplication does not occur. This language is coded 0.

GB159,Are nouns reduplicated?,"## Are nouns reduplicated?

## Summary

A noun is reduplicated if its root is fully or partially repeated. The word class of the outcome of the process is not relevant, as long as the root is a noun. Full repetition of already inflected nouns or units larger than a root does not trigger a 1 for this feature. This feature only targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) reduplication. Reduplication in closed classes (e.g. kinship terms) is not relevant. Lexicalized examples are irrelevant.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions productive reduplication of nouns.
2. Code 1 if you identify productively reduplicated nouns in a source.
3. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no productive reduplication (of nouns).
4. Code 0 if a source discusses reduplication of verbs or other items but not of nouns.
5. Code 0 if the only instances of reduplicated nouns are lexicalized.
6. Code ? if there are examples that contain potential reduplicated nouns but their analysis remains inconclusive. 
7. Code ? if you suspect the author may have missed or disregarded reduplicated nouns.

## Examples

**Leti** (ISO 693-3: lti, Glottolog: leti1246)

In Leti, adjectives can be derived from nouns by means of reduplication (van Engelenhoven 2004: 101-102, 123). Leti is coded 1 for this feature.

```
üau ‘idiot, n.’   → üa-üau ‘idiot[ic], adj.’
lèpa ‘fool’       → lèplèpa ‘foolish’
mèla ‘night’      → mèl-mèla ‘by night, dark’
```

**Loup A** (ISO 693-3: xlo, Glottolog: loup1243)

In Loup A, there are some examples of reduplicated plural nouns corresponding to simplex singular nouns, but this reduplication process is not productive (Gustafson 2000: 48–49). Because there is no productive reduplication for nouns, this language is coded 0.
	
```
sankecem8 ‘good hunting dog’     -> sasanekecem8ek ‘good hunting dogs’
8ik8an ‘dull thing’              -> 8a8ik8aněs ‘dull things’

GB160,Are elements apart from verbs or nouns reduplicated?,"## Are elements apart from verbs or nouns reduplicated?

## Summary

A lexeme is reduplicated if its root is fully or partially repeated. The word class of the outcome of the process is not relevant, as long as the root is not a noun or a verb. Reduplication of function words counts, as does reduplication of numerals, adjectives and adverbs. Full repetition of already inflected words or units larger than a root does not trigger a 1 for this feature. This feature only targets [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) reduplication. Lexicalized examples are irrelevant. For open word classes, this means that reduplication should not be limited to a small set of lexically determined roots. For closed word classes, any transparent reduplication counts as long as the non-reduplicated root is also still used. Roots that only occur in their reduplicated form should be considered lexicalized reduplications.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions productive reduplication of any word class that is different from verbs and nouns.
2. Code 1 if you identify productive reduplication of items that are not verbs or nouns in a source.
3. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no productive reduplication of items beyond verbs and/or nouns.
4. Code 0 if a source discusses reduplication for nouns and/or verbs, but does not discuss reduplication for other items.
5. Code 0 if the only instances of reduplication beyond verbs and nouns in the language are lexicalized. For open word classes, this means that reduplication would only apply to a small set of lexically determined roots. For closed word classes, this means that the simplex root of a reduplicated item is no longer available as a separate word.
6. Code ? if there are examples that contain potential reduplication without verbal or nominal roots but their analysis remains inconclusive. 
7. Code ? if you suspect the author may have missed or disregarded reduplication of items beyond verbs and nouns in the language.

## Examples

**Leti** (ISO 693-3: lti, Glottolog: leti1246)

In Leti, reduplication derives adjectives from cardinal numerals (van Engelenhoven 2004: 101–102, 164). Leti is coded 1.

```
vòtelu ‘three’        → vò-te-telu ‘third’
sanunu ‘ten’          → sa-nu-nunu ‘tenth’
v(ï)èl-sia ‘ninety’   → v(ï)èl-si-sia ‘ninetieth’
```

**Nyam** (ISO 693-3: nmi, Glottolog: nyam1285)

In Nyam, demonstratives may be reduplicated to emphasize the particular referent that is singled out (Andreas 2012: 113-114). Nyam is coded 1.

```
a. lìbàŋ-éndɔ̀
   child-PROX
   ‘this child (here)’ 
			
b. lìbàŋ-énd~èndɔ̀
   child-PROX~PROX
   ‘this very child (here)’
				
c. lìbàŋ-énjì
   child-DIST1
   ‘that child (visible)’

d. lìbàŋ-énj~ènjì
   child-DIST1~DIST1
   ‘that very child (visible)’
```

**Nubi** (ISO 693-3: kcn, Glottolog: nubi1253)

In Nubi, reduplication of adjectives indicates intensity (Wellens 2003: 82). Nubi is coded 1.

```
'Sika    'de   'kan    ba'tal-ba'tal.
Road(s)  DEF   be-ANT  bad-REDUP
‘The roads were very bad.’ (Wellens 2003: 82)
```

**Lozi** (ISO 639-3: loz, Glottolog: lozi1239)

Lozi does not have productive reduplication and is coded 0. Reduplicated ideophones occur, but the corresponding non-reduplicated forms do not occur, so this reduplication process is historical rather than synchronically productive. See Fortune (2001: 103).

```
cupwa cupwa     ‘walking in water’
nga nga nga     ‘shivering’
nyame nyame     ‘disappearing’
pululu          ‘being grey in colour’
temu temu       ‘looking round speechless’
```

**Abu' Arapesh** (ISO 639-3: aah, Glottolog: abua1245)

In Abu' Arapesh, repetition and reduplication is only productive in child language (Nekitel 1985: 174). Abu' Arapesh is coded 0.
	
**Yulu** (ISO 639-3: yul, Glottolog: yulu1243)

For Yulu, Santandrea (1970: 79) explicitly mentions that reduplication does not occur. Yulu is coded 0.

GB165,Is there productive morphological trial marking on nouns?,"## Is there a productive morphological trial marker on nouns?

## Summary
This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of trial number on nouns. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB319 Is trial number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB319) which focuses on the non-bound marking of trial number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.

Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.

It can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.

The trial marker may be similar to the numeral for ‘three’, but it is crucial that it is used in a similar morphosyntactic manner to other number markers in the language.

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with number or nominal morphology.
2. If the author describes a bound marker of trial number on the noun that occurs regularly, code 1.
3. If the only marking of trial number occurs on nouns derived from other word classes (adjectives, verbs, etc.) or on a small subset of nouns, code 0.
4. If the grammar mentions that trial number is not marked productively, or that it is marked somewhere else than on the noun, code as 0.
5. If the grammar does not describe number marking at all and you have a reason to believe that the author may have missed it, code ?.
6. If the grammar does not describe number, you encounter no examples of number marking, and the grammar is otherwise comprehensive, code 0.

## Examples
**Northwest Kiwai** (ISO 639-3: kiw, Glottolog: nort2930) 

Trial marking is not common, and since a similar enough meaning can often be expressed with a plural marker, trial is rarely (if ever) described as being obligatory. However, there are instances where trial markers appear on the noun. These trial markers are different from the numeral for ‘three’ (Brown et al. 2016: 25). Kiwai is coded as 1 for this feature.

```
a. Umi=obi  ro  pusi  p-obodidio      bi=mo 
   dog=TRL  NOM cat   DIST.PST-chase  TRL=PL
   ‘Three dogs chased the cat.’ (Brown et al. 2016: 25)

b. netua ga'u
   two   one
   ‘three (numeral)’ (Brown et al. 2016: 46)
```

GB166,Is there productive morphological paucal marking on nouns?,"## Is there a productive morphological paucal marker on nouns?

## Summary
This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of paucal number on nouns (From Latin _paucalis_ ‘few, little’). Paucal is a number value that refers to a non-specified small amount usually between two or more and ten or less. The exact value can depend on what is being counted. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB320 Is paucal number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB320) which focuses on the non-bound marking of paucal number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.

Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.

It can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with number or nominal morphology.
2. If the author describes a bound marker of paucal number on the noun that occurs regularly, code 1.
3. If the only marking of paucal number occurs on nouns derived from other word classes (adjectives, verbs etc.) or on a small subset of nouns, code 0.
4. If the grammar mentions that paucal number is not marked productively, or that it is marked somewhere else than on the noun, code as 0.
5. If the grammar does not describe number marking at all and you have a reason to believe that the author may have missed it, code ?.
6. If the grammar does not describe number, you encounter no examples of number marking, and the grammar is otherwise comprehensive, code 0.

## Examples
**Sa** (ISO 639-3: sax, Glottolog: saaa1241)

Paucal marking is not common, and since a similar enough meaning can often be expressed with a plural marker it is rarely (if ever) described as being obligatory. However, there are instances where markers of paucal number appear on the noun. Sa is an example of a 1 code for this feature: there is a paucal suffix (and a trial suffix).

```
a. asalsal-ir-pat
   whiteman-PL-PAU
   ‘white men (3 or 4)’ (Elliot 1976: 45)

b. dam-ir-til

   ‘yams (3 exactly)’ (Elliot 1976: 45)

c. kuli-r

```

GB167,Is there a logophoric pronoun?,"## Is there a logophoric pronoun?

## Summary
Logophoric pronouns are used to distinguish reference to an individual whose speech or thought or feeling is being reported, as opposed to other third-person referents. Unsurprisingly, then, logophoric pronouns are found in reported speech contexts. This question concerns the existence of a special pronoun that specifically refers to the speaker/thinker/feeler in a reported speech construction. This special pronominal form occurs commonly in the complement clause of a speech or thought verb to designate the speaker/thinker/feeler (who is often also the subject of the speech/thought verb) as its referent.

## Procedure
1. If there is a third person pronominal form that is used to indicate reference to the individual whose speech/thought is represented in the relevant clause,
2. And if this pronoun has a different form than the third person personal and reflexive pronouns, then code 1.
3. If the logophoric pronoun meets the criteria in (1) and (2) above, but is derived from another pronoun, code 1.
4. If there is no difference in the pro-form used when the referent in a reported speech clause is the individual whose speech is reported vs. a different individual, code 0.

## Examples

**Ewe** (ISO 639-3: ewe, Glottolog: ewee1241)

Ewe is coded 1, because there is a special anaphoric pro-form used to indicate that the speaker (Kofi) who is the subject of the first clause is also the subject of the second clause, as in (a). When Kofi is not the subject of the subordinate clause, a non-logophoric third person pronoun is used, as in (b).

```
a. Kofi be   yè-dzo
   Kofi say  LOG-leave
   ‘Kofi(i) said he(i) was leaving.’ (Clements 1975: 142)

b. Kofi  be  e-dzo
   Kofi  say 3SG-leave
   ‘Kofi(i) said he/she(j) was leaving.’ (Clements 1975: 142)
```

**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

Ewe contrasts with a language like English, where no logophoric pronoun exists, and both of these meanings are expressed with the same form:

```
John(i) said he(i/j) was leaving.
```

This can mean that either John was leaving and said so, or that John said that someone else was leaving. English is coded 0.

GB170,Can an adnominal property word agree with the noun in gender/noun class?,"## Can an adnominal property word agree with the noun in noun class/gender?

## Summary
For this feature, we are interested in [noun classes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) (classes which nouns belong to based on properties such as gender, animacy, or shape and can be identified through [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with a modifier). We are not looking at noun classifiers (classifiers classify the noun and occur independently from other elements). This feature asks whether adjectives (defined semantically as ‘adnominal property words’) show agreement with the noun class/gender of nouns they modify. This should be true for [more than a small class of semantically restricted adjectives](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity); English ‘blond’ vs. ‘blonde’ for example would not be enough to answer 1 for the question. 

## Procedure
1.  Code 1 if adjectives agree in noun class/gender with nouns in at least one context (e.g. in the plural).
2.  Code 0 if the author states that there is no gender/noun class system, or it is apparent from the data there is no gender/noun class system.
3.  Code 0 if there is evidence of a gender/noun class system but the system is not productive.
3.  Code ? if the author does not discuss gender/noun class and the data is too limited to assess its existence.

## Examples

**Kambaata** (ISO 639-3: ktb, Glottolog: kamb1316)

Coded 1. Adjectives (the targets of agreement) agree in case and gender with their head nouns (the controllers of agreement) (Treis 2008: 256–257).

```

**Wadjiginy** (ISO 639-3: wdj, Glottolog: wadj1254)

## Summary
For this feature, we are interested in [noun classes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) (classes which nouns belong to based on properties such as gender, animacy, or shape and can be identified through [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with a modifier). We are not looking at noun classifiers (classifiers classify the noun and occur independently from other elements). Demonstratives are adnominal modifiers that mark position. This feature asks whether demonstratives can agree in gender/noun class with their head noun, whether or not the head noun is overtly marked for gender/noun class. 

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if there is a morpheme that is used with at least some demonstratives to indicate noun class agreement with their head noun,
2. And there is a fixed number of these morphemes (i.e. a fixed number of genders, as opposed to them being classifiers).
3. Code 0 if the author states that there is no gender/noun class system, or if there is no evidence of this in the data.

## Examples

**Bena (Tanzania)** (ISO 639-3: bez, Glottolog: bena1262)

Coded 1. ""Morphologically, demonstratives are marked to agree with their head noun in class; all demonstratives are composed of an agreement class marker and some sort of demonstrative stem"" (Morrison 2011: 126–127).

GB177,"Can the verb carry a marker of animacy of argument, unrelated to any gender/noun class of the argument visible in the NP domain?","## Can the verb carry a marker of animacy of argument, unrelated to any noun class/gender of the argument visible in the NP domain?

## Summary
Does the animacy of an argument ([S or A or P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P))) determine the form or presence of an [index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) on the verb. This system of marking needs to be unrelated to or not reducible to the [gender/noun class system](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) as revealed by [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) in the noun phrase.

## Procedure
1. Check the section on verbal morphology to identify whether the language has any indexing at all. Code 0 if it does not.
2. If there is indexing, consider which categories are indexed on the verb. Code 0 if only person and/or number and/or clusivity are indexed and the marking is identical for both animate and inanimate referents.
3. If there is indexing of the animacy feature or animacy conditions the use of allomorphs (including zero marking) for number or person marking, this is potentially a 1. Consider the agreement features within an NP and the respective gender/noun classes. Code 1 if the sets of referents identified on the basis of verbal indexing is not identical to the sets of referents identified on the basis of agreement with an NP. 
4. Code 0 if the same gender/noun class as the ones identified on the basis of agreement within an NP are found in the indexing system.

## Examples
**Anamuxra** (ISO 639-3: imi, Glottolog: anam1248) 

In Anamuxra animacy determines the indexing on the verbs of subjects (S/A) and objects (P). Each of these two cases alone would suffice for 1 (see Ingram 2001: 196, 307). 
""In transitive clauses, only animate P objects are indexed on the verb, while inanimate P objects are not."" (Ingram 2001: 307)

```
a. u-mka=x             aku-i   n-simu-pa-n
   INDF-ANIM=ACC.SG    far-OBL 3SG.O-spear-PST-1SG.S
   ‘I speared one (pig) over there.’ (Ingram 2001: 217)

b.  mugux-a-ka           uns-pa         p-xada-pa-ri
    house-PROX-RESIDUAL  fire-RESIDUAL  get-EXH-PST-3SG.S
    ‘The fire got the whole house.’ (Ingram 2001: 227)
```

Animacy also matters for how subjects are indexed (S/A arguments). According to Ingram (2001: 196), ""bound pronominal suffixes are used to indicate number in case of animate subjects; for inanimate subjects the third person singular is used regardless of number."" This alone would also be sufficient for 1. Though animacy also determines the type of possessive construction used, this is not revealed by agreement in the noun phrase and thus does not qualify as gender/noun class visible in the NP domain. Anamuxra is coded 1.

**Kagulu** (ISO 639-3: kki, Glottolog: kagu1239) 

In Kagulu, S/A and P arguments can be indexed on the verb. For third person arguments, the form of the indexes is determined by the noun class of the respective noun, i.e. it reflects noun classes of arguments visible in the NP domain. Whereas human nouns generally belong to class 1 (in singular) and 2 (in plural) and trigger class 1/2 indexes, animals often belong to class 5/6 and trigger class 5/6 indexes. Petzell (2008: 48) describes the situation in the following way: ""Animacy considerations are not of paramount importance in Kagulu nouns. This means that in some other Bantu languages such as Swahili [G42], an animal or another animate noun triggers agreement from an animate class (usually class 1). In Kagulu, however, the nouns always trigger agreement from their inherent class."" Kagulu is coded as 0.

GB184,Can an adnominal property word agree with the noun in number?,"## Can an adnominal property word agree with the noun in number?

## Summary
Adnominal property words semantically roughly correspond to adjectives in languages that have a separate adjective class. The property word can agree in number with the head noun even if the head noun is not overtly marked for number. 

## Procedure

1.  Code 1 if at least some adnominal property words overtly agree with the number of the head noun they modify.
2.  Code 0 if the author states that there is no agreement, or if there is no evidence of this in the data. 

## Examples

**Yeri** (ISO 639-3: yev, Glottolog: yapu1240)

Coded 1 (Wilson 2017: 129–132). Adjectives show plural agreement with their head noun, even if the head noun does not have a plural marker.

```
neigal  sɨpekɨ-i   yot-u-i       ∅-o           tapo.
cuscus  little-PL  DEM-MDIST-PL  3pl-stay.REAL tree.hole
‘Those small cuscuses live in the hole of the tree.’ 
```

**Barambu** (ISO 639-3: brm, Glottolog: bara1361)

Coded 1. The plural prefix is occasionally attached to adjectives. Plurality may also be shown through reduplication.

```
ä-gú̹ɽú̹-gu̹ɽu̹      a-ŋguà
PL-short-REDUP   PL-tree
‘short trees’ (Tucker & Bryan 1966: 146)
```

**Kenga** (ISO 639-3: kyq, Glottolog: keng1240)

Coded 1. In Kenga, the plural clitic can attach to the end of the noun phrase, so also to the adjective (Vandame 1968: 18–21).

GB185,Can an adnominal demonstrative agree with the noun in number?,"## Can an adnominal demonstrative agree with the noun in number?

## Summary
This question concerns adnominal demonstratives (not pronominal demonstratives) and whether they can agree in number with the head noun. Number marking on demonstratives counts as agreement even if the head noun is not overtly marked for number. 

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is a marker that is used with demonstratives that varies according to the number of the head noun or if demonstratives have a different form according to the number of the head noun.
2. Code 0 if the author states that there is no number agreement on adnominal demonstratives, or if there is no evidence for agreement in the data.
3. Code ? if there appears to be agreement, but it is unclear whether it is agreement for number.

## Examples
**Haitian** (ISO 639-3: hat, Glottolog: hait1244)

Coded 1. ""In Creole, the demonstrative determiner makes the noun more specific. It has the forms: _sa-a_
for the singular, _sa-yo_ for the plural."" (Valdman 1988: 27)

```
a. Li achte  chemiz-sa-a

b. Kote   timoun-sa-yo?
   where  children-DEM-PL
   ‘Where are these/those children?’ (Valdman 1988: 27)
```

**Hulaulá** (ISO 639-3: huy, Glottolog: hula1244)

Coded 0. Attributive demonstratives do not inflect for number. Demonstratives only inflect for number if they are used as pronouns (Khan 2009: 60).

GB186,Can an article agree with the noun in number?,"## Can an article agree with the noun in number?

## Summary
An article is a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity and (in)definiteness. When an article is marked for number, this counts as agreement even if the head noun is not overtly marked for number. This includes both definite and indefinite articles.

## Procedure
1.  Code 1 if there is a marker that is used with articles that varies according to the number of the head noun, or if articles have a different form depending on the number of the head noun.
2. Code 0 if articles do not agree with the noun in number.
3. Code ? if there appears to be agreement but it is unclear whether it is agreement for number.

## Examples
**Mele-Fila** (ISO 639-3: mxe, Glottolog: mele1250)

Coded 1. Articles in Mele-Fila mark distinctions of number, definiteness and affection. Articles prefix to the noun and agree for singular, dual/paucal and plural number. Mele-Fila is coded 1. 
```
a. te-fare
   DEF.SG-house
   ‘the house’ (Clark 2002: 684)

(Abbreviations: AFC affective)
```
**Eastern Armenian** (ISO 639-3: hye, Glottolog: nucl1235)

Coded 0. When the noun is plural, it is marked with a plural case marker suffix which is followed by the definite article suffix. For this to be coded 1, there would need to be agreement on the definite article even if number is not marked on the noun. In this case, both number and the definite article are marked on the noun.

```
Gyułaci-ner-ě      gnac-’in    dašt.

GB187,Is there any productive diminutive marking on the noun (exclude marking by system of nominal classification only)?,"## Is there any productive diminutive marking on the noun (exclude marking by system of nominal classification only)?

## Summary
Diminutive marking encodes smaller size. This marker must be [phonologically bound to the noun](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). The marker may also encode other meanings but needs to minimally encode smaller size. Reduplication and stem changes count. This needs to be a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) pattern.

## Procedure

1.  Code 1 if there is a phonologically bound morpheme on nouns that denotes small size that is not also a noun class marker.
2. Code 0 if the only diminutive marker(s) is/are phonologically free. 
3. Code ? if the source is not comprehensive and may have missed a bound diminutive marker.

## Examples

**Nend** (ISO 639-3: anh, Glottolog: nend1239)  

Nend is coded 1. Diminutives are marked by reduplication (Harris 1990:135).

```
a. iliv ‘bow’           iliv iliv ‘toy bow’
b. olam ‘house’         olam olam ‘shelter/blind’
c. alaz ‘flying fox’    alaz alaz ‘small bat’
(Harris 1990: 135)
```

**Ainu** (ISO 639-3: ain, Glottolog: ainu1240)

Ainu is coded 1. The diminutive marker _-po_ attaches to words referring to small or trifling things. It may also express a nuance of affection or familiarity (Tamura 2000: 221).

```
cep-po
fish-DIM
‘small fish’ (Tamura 2000: 221)
```

**Awa-Cuaiquer** (ISO 639-3:  kwi, Glottolog: awac1239)

Coded 0. Diminutive meaning in Awa-Cuaiquer is expressed by means of the word for ‘child’ (Curnow 1997: 89).

GB188,Is there any productive augmentative marking on the noun (exclude marking by system of nominal classification only)?,"## Is there any productive augmentative marking on the noun (exclude marking by system of nominal classification only)?

## Summary
Augmentative marking generally intensifies the noun (in various ways). To code 1, the marker needs to minimally encode a large size of the noun it is attached to. This needs to be a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) pattern.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if there is a morpheme which is phonologically bound to nouns and which denotes a large version of the noun it is attached to.
2. Code 0 if augmentatives are only expressed by a shift of gender/noun class and consider [GB314](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB314).
3. Code 0 if the author states there are no augmentative markers or if there is extensive evidence of their absence. 
4. Code ? if there is not enough evidence. 

## Examples

**Hixkaryana** (ISO 639-3: hix, Glottolog: hixk1239) 

Coded 1. There is a phonologically bound augmentative marker on the noun marking larger size (Derbyshire 1979:83-4).

GB192,Is there a gender system where a noun's phonological properties are a factor in class assignment?,"## Is there a noun class/gender system where a noun’s phonological properties are a factor in class assignment?

## Summary
A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the phonological properties of a noun constitute one of these factors for a given language. For this feature to be coded 1, there must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of specific phonological properties. That is, some phonological property of a noun must be one relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. Examples of phonological properties that may play a role in gender/class assignment include tone, initial consonants, or root-final segments. Note that noun class/gender morphology may create phonological similarities across members of a certain noun class or gender; however, this is not sufficient for a 1 coding for this feature. Phonological properties must contribute to the categorization of nouns to classes/genders, rather than simply result from associated morphology.

## Procedure
1. If there is [a system of nominal classification](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) where some markers vary based on the category of the noun,
2. And if these markers are **not** used only with numerals, demonstratives, and possessors (or some subset of these categories),
3. And if these markers are involved in [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) within the noun phrase, inflectional marking of the noun, or [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns),
4. And if there seems to be a correlation between a noun's noun class/gender and specific phonological properties of the noun, then code 1.
3. Code 0 if there is no class/gender system or the assignment of nouns to classes/genders does not pattern according to phonological properties of the noun.

## Examples
**Kilen** (Glottolog: kile1243)

There are two classes of nouns in Kilen: one for /n/-final stems and one for vowel-final stems. Allomorphy of nominal suffixes is determined by these two categories, which correspond to the final sound of the stem (Zhang 2013: 77).

| Case | V-final | n-final |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --- | xas&#808;i ‘warehouse’ | jafux&#601;n ‘garden’ |
| NOM | xas&#808;i-&#216; | jafux&#601;n-&#216; |
| ACC | xas&#808;i-w&#601; | jafux&#601;n-m&#601; |
| GEN | xas&#808;i-ji | jafux&#601;n-i |
| DAT | xas&#808;i-d&#601; | jafux&#601;n-du |
| LOC | xas&#808;i-l&#601; | jafux&#601;n-dul&#601; |
| PROL | xas&#808;i-li | jafux&#601;n-duli |

Table 5.1 Case Suffixes (Zhang 2013: 80)

Kilen is coded as 1.

**North Levantine Arabic** (ISO 639-3: apc, Glottolog: nort3139)

For nouns that are neither names nor human designations, gender cannot be inferred from meaning but usually from form: singular nouns ending in *-e/-a/-ʔ/-t* are feminine (Cowell 1964: 209). This language is coded 1.

GB193,What is the order of adnominal property word and noun?,"## What is the order of adnominal property word and noun?

## Summary
Adnominal property words are also known as ""adjectives"", in particular in those languages where they make up a separate word class. We want to include elements that mark ‘adjectival’ function but that might not be described as ‘adjectives’, see [GB069](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB069). The question concerns the pragmatically neutral order(s).  

## Procedure

1.  Code 1 if most adnominal property words are placed before nouns.
2.  Code 2 if most adnominal property words are placed after nouns.	
3.  Code 3 if adnominal property words can be placed before or after nouns, either because both orders are possible or because some adjectives precede and some follow the noun.
4.  Code 0 if property words cannot be used attributively.
5.  Do not code 0 if property words are a sub-class of verbs: code 1, 2 or 3.

## Examples

**Amma** (ISO 639-3: amm, Glottolog: amap1240) 

Coded 3, adjectives may be placed before and after the noun.
```
sopo nu    siyoli 
tall house big
‘a big and tall house’ (Årsjö 1999: 94)
```

**Maco** (ISO 639-3: wpc, Glottolog: maco1239)
 
Coded 2, when adjectives are used attributively they usually follow the underived noun.

```
wiɾi ɨwaɾi-ˀbo       dew-aˀbo            hũn-an-õ-∅
dog  tail-CL.OBLONG  be.white-CL.OBLONG  have-DUR-CL.M-3.COP
‘the dog has a white tail’ 
(lit. a tail that is white=a tail a white one) (Rosés Labrada 2015: 283)
```

**Ghadames** (ISO 639-3: gha, Glottolog: ghad1239)
  
Coded 0, attribution of adjectival concepts is basically achieved by means of relative clauses with stative verbs in the participial form. 

```

GB196,Is there a male/female distinction in 2nd person independent pronouns?,"## Is there a masculine/feminine distinction in phonologically independent second person pronouns?

## Summary
This feature asks whether the [phonologically independent pronoun](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) forms used for second persons differ for masculine and feminine referents. This masculine/feminine distinction is a minimal contrast required for the coding of this feature, but other gender categories may also be encoded in second person pronoun forms. Pronoun systems that encode other grammatical gender/noun class categories in second person forms in the absence of a masculine/feminine distinction are not sufficient to satisfy this criterion. Languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature will include a distinction between masculine and feminine forms in at least some categories of second person independent pronouns, but possibly not all categories. In many languages this contrast occurs only in the singular pronouns; that is, there is a contrast between masculine and feminine forms for second person singular, but not for second person plural (or dual, or any other non-singular number category). In some languages there is a contrast in multiple number categories, including singular and some non-singular number categories. It is uncommon for a language to have a masculine/feminine contrast in non-singular second person pronouns but not in the singular pronouns. However such languages would also satisfy the criteria for this feature. For more information on the difference between grammatical gender and social, cultural, and biological constructs or traits, see the [gender wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Grammatical-gender-and-other-notions-of-gender).

## Procedure
1. If the language has second person independent pronouns that take a different form depending on whether the referent is masculine or feminine, code 1.
2. If the language has second person independent pronouns that do not contrast in gender, code 0.
3. If the language has second person independent pronouns that do not encode a masculine/feminine gender contrast, but do encode some other distinctions in gender, code ? and provide a comment about the contrast that is encoded in these pronouns.

## Examples
**Standard Arabic** (ISO 639-3: arb, Glottolog: stan1318)

Arabic independent pronouns include masculine and feminine forms for the second person singular and plural.

*Second person independent personal pronouns*

| Gender | Singular | Dual | Plural |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| masculine | 'anta |  | 'antum |
| feminine | 'anti |  | 'antunna |
| non-specific |  | 'antumaa |  |

(Ryding 2005: 298)

Although there is only one second person dual personal pronoun which can be interpreted as either masculine or feminine, the presence of a masculine/feminine distinction in the singular and plural forms is sufficient to trigger a 1 for this feature for Standard Arabic.


**Wandala** (ISO 639-3: mfi, Glottolog: wand1278)

Wandala’s independent pronoun system encodes three person categories, two number categories, and an inclusive/exclusive distinction in first person pronouns, but no gender categories for any person or number category.

*Wandala independent pronouns*

| Person| Singular | Plural |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | íyyà | míyà (INCL) |
|  |  | ŋrè (EXCL) |
| 2 | ə̀kká | kùré |
| 3 | ŋánè | ítàrè or ítèrè |

(Frajzyngier 2012: 107) 

Wandala has no gender contrast in second person independent pronouns, so it is coded 0.

GB197,Is there a male/female distinction in 1st person independent pronouns?,"## Is there a masculine/feminine distinction in phonologically independent first person pronouns?

## Summary
This feature asks whether the [phonologically independent pronoun](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) forms used for first person differ for masculine and feminine referents. This masculine/feminine distinction is a minimal contrast required for the coding of this feature, but other gender categories may also be encoded in a language’s first person pronoun forms. Pronoun systems that encode other grammatical gender/noun class categories in first person forms in the absence of a masculine/feminine distinction are not sufficient to satisfy this criterion. Languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature will include a distinction between masculine and feminine forms in at least some categories of first person independent pronouns, but possibly not all categories. In many languages this contrast occurs only in the singular pronouns; that is, there is a contrast between masculine and feminine forms for first person singular, but not for first person plural (or dual, or any other non-singular number category). In some languages there is a relevant contrast in multiple number categories, including singular and some non-singular number categories. It is uncommon for a language to have a masculine/feminine contrast in non-singular first person pronouns but not in the singular pronouns. However, such languages also satisfy the criteria for this feature. For more information on the difference between grammatical gender and social, cultural, and biological constructs or traits, see the [gender wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Grammatical-gender-and-other-notions-of-gender).

## Procedure
1. If the language has first person independent pronouns that take a different form depending on whether the referent is masculine or feminine, code 1.
2. If the language has first person independent pronouns that do not contrast in gender, code 0.
3. If the language has first person independent pronouns that do not encode a masculine/feminine gender contrast, but do encode some other distinctions in gender, code ? and provide a comment about the contrast that is encoded in these pronouns.

## Examples
**Thai** (ISO 639-3: tha, Glottolog: thai1261)

Thai has a complex set of independent personal pronouns. Among the basic pronouns are first person forms that vary by masculine/feminine gender.

*First person singular pronouns*
| Gender | Form |
| --- | --- |
| male | ph&#466;m |
| female (informal) | ch&#225;n |
| female (formal) | dich&#225;n |

(Smyth 2002: 39)

The contrast between these independent first person singular pronouns is sufficient to trigger a 1 for this feature in Thai. 

**Achumawi** (ISO 639-3: acv, Glottolog: achu1247)

The independent personal pronouns provided by de Angulo & Freeland (1930) include first person forms that encode a number contrast, but no contrasts in gender.

*First person pronouns*
| Translation | Form |
| --- | --- |
| ‘I’ | ìtt |
| ‘we both’ | ìttú |
| ‘we all’ | tó·lól |

(de Angulo & Freeland 1930: 84)

Achumawi has no masculine/feminine contrast in the first person independent pronouns, and is coded 0.

GB198,Can an adnominal numeral agree with the noun in gender/noun class?,"## Can an adnominal numeral agree with the noun in noun class/gender?

## Summary
For this feature, we are interested in [gender/noun classes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) (classes which nouns belong to based upon properties such as gender, animacy, or shape and can be identified through [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with a modifier). We are not looking at noun classifiers ([GB057](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB057)) (classifiers classify the noun and occur independently from other elements). This feature asks whether adnominal numerals show agreement with the gender of nouns they modify. This system of agreement should be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity).

If only the numeral ""one"" shows this agreement, that is sufficient.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if adnominal numerals agree in gender/noun class with nouns in at least one context (e.g. in the plural).
2. Code 0 if the author states that there is no gender/noun class system, or it is apparent from the data there is no gender/noun class system.
3. Code 0 if there is evidence of a gender/noun class system but the author states that the system is no longer productive in the context of adnominal numerals.
4. Code ? if the author does not discuss a gender/noun class system and the data is too limited to assess whether one exists.

## Examples

**Abkhaz** (ISO 639-3: abk, Glottolog: abkh1244) 

Coded 1. The cardinals take class agreement markers. ‘One’ has suppletive forms for humans and non-humans. For non-human nouns, cardinal numerals take the suffix *-ba/pa*. For human nouns they take the suffix *-j°ə(-k')*. Ordinal and other numerals take no agreement (Chirikba 2003: 34–35; Hewitt 2010: 33–35).

**Cicipu** (ISO 639-3: awc, Glottolog: cici1237) 

Coded 1. The adnominal numeral agrees with the noun in noun class (McGill 2009: 285-286).
```
kà-bárá      ká-mpà     kà-yápù
NC1-old.man  AG1-this   AG1-two
‘these two old men’ (McGill 2009: 203)
```
**Aja (Sudan)** (ISO 639-3: aja, Glottolog: ajas1235) 

Coded 0. There is no grammatical gender system. Different words are used to distinguish male from female persons; to indicate whether an animal is male or female, a word for ‘male’ or ‘female’ is added to the noun (Santandrea 1976: 73–75).

**Yuki** [ISO 639-3: yuk, Glottolog: yuki1243]

Coded ?. Adnominals seem to be able to take patient-argument marking; this occurs only when the noun is animate. The data is too scant to tell which is a consequence of the other (Balodis 2011: 176–179).

GB203,What is the order of the adnominal collective universal quantifier ('all') and the noun?,"## What is the order of the adnominal collective universal quantifier (‘all’) and the noun?

## Summary
This feature is concerned with the ordering of a universal quantifier (‘all’) and the noun. As with other word order features in this database, this is focused specifically on adnominal quantification in pragmatically unmarked contexts. In languages that do not have a distinction between collective and distributive universal quantifiers (‘all’ vs. ‘every’), a quantifier that could be translated as ‘all’ and has a primarily plural use will be a sufficient target for this feature.

There are four possible codes for this feature, reflecting the fact that the collective universal quantifier might occur strictly before or strictly after the noun, may be allowed in both of these relative positions, or may not be present in a language. A 0 code is also applicable when the language does not allow a basic construction with an adnominal collective universal quantifier and a noun (e.g. if only a floating construction is used).

Orders that result from constructions like quantifier float (e.g. English *The children have **all** come.*) should be disregarded for the purposes of coding this feature.

## Procedure		
1. If there is a collective universal quantifier, or a general universal quantifier that can be translated as ‘all’, and that quantifier occurs only before the noun (UQ-N), code 1.
2. If there is a collective universal quantifier, or a general universal quantifier that can be translated as ‘all’, and that quantifier occurs only after the noun (N-UQ), code 2.
3. If the collective universal quantifier or equivalent can occur either before or after the noun (UQ-N *or* N-UQ) in non-quantifier float constructions, code 3.
4. If there is no collective universal quantifier or other universal quantifier that can be translated as ‘all’ and be used in an adnominal construction, code 0.
5. If there is no mention of universal quantifiers at all, code ? and note that there is insufficient information to make a determination.

## Examples

**Kwara'ae** (ISO 639-3: kwf, Glottolog: kwar1239)

Quantifiers in Kwara'ae, including the universal quantifier (*teqhou* ‘all’), generally precede the noun they modify. The quantifier *teqhou* in particular can be used in a quantifier float construction where it is non-contiguous with the nominal it is modifying and may follow the noun in these constructions, as below.

```
keik          leak teqhou naq   an sa  tol  
IMP.1PL.EXCL  go   all    COMPL to LOC inland  
‘We all went inland.’ (Macdonald 2010: 164)
```

Quantifier float constructions are disregarded for coding, so Kwara'ae is coded 1.

**Ura** (ISO 639-3: uur, Glottolog: urav1235)

Very few modifiers can precede the head noun in Ura, one of which is the universal quantifier *alauriyekye* ‘all’. This form can also occur in a postnominal position in Ura with no change in meaning (Crowley 1999: 187-188). Because both orders are possible and neither involves a quantifier float construction or a pragmatically marked context, Ura is coded 3.

**Central Nicobarese** (ISO 639-3: ncb, Glottolog: cent1990)

In Central Nicobarese, there is no universal quantifier that can be used adnominally; this function is expressed by a predicate (Rajasingh 2016: 36–37). Central Nicobarese is coded 0 due to the lack of an adnominal universal quantifier.

GB204,Do collective ('all') and distributive ('every') universal quantifiers differ in their forms or their syntactic positions?,"## Do collective (‘all’) and distributive (‘every’) universal quantifiers differ in their forms or their syntactic positions?

## Summary
This feature identifies languages that use different forms or syntactic positions for collective universal quantification (e.g. English *all*) versus distributive universal quantification (e.g. English *every*). This contrasts with languages that use both the same form *and* the same word order for these two types of quantification.

## Procedure
1. If the language uses different forms for collective universal quantification (‘all’) and distributive universal quantification (‘every’), code 1.
2. If the language uses a single form for both collective and distributive universal quantifiers (i.e. one form means *both* ‘all’ and ‘every’), but they differ in terms of word order/syntactic position when expressing these different meanings, code 1.
3. If the language uses a single form in the same syntactic position to express both collective and distributive universal quantification, code 0.
4. If there is no mention of universal quantifiers at all, code ? and note that there is insufficient information to make a determination.

## Examples
**Cholón** (ISO 639-3: cht, Glottolog: chol1284)

In Cholón, the meanings ‘all’ and ‘every’ are expressed by different forms: *mek* ‘all’ and *nʸanmak* ‘every’.

```
a. mek angel-a    espiritu-lʸ  če-kt-aŋ   
   all angel-TOP  spirit-RST   3PL.S-be-INCMPL
   ‘As for all the angels, they are spirits only.’ (Alexander-Bakkerus 2005: 175)

b. nʸanmak hayu       i-tˢip-te            i-tˢotˢ   
   every   Indian/man 3PL.POSS-house-ADESS 3PL.POSS-guinea.pig   
   ‘Every Indian has guinea pigs in his house.’ (Alexander-Bakkerus 2005: 175)

(Abbreviations: RST restrictive)
```

Both *mek* ‘all’ and *nʸanmak* ‘every’ can either precede or follow the noun (Alexander-Bakkerus 2005: 173–175). However, because the forms for these quantificational meanings are different, Cholón is coded 1.

**Hausa States Fulfulde** (ISO 639-3: fuv, Glottolog: nige1253)

In this language both the meaning ‘all’ and the meaning ‘every’ are expressed by the same marker (*fuu*). However, the marker precedes the noun when it is used for the meaning ‘every’ and follows the noun when it is used with the meaning ‘all’ (Arnott 1970: 147, 276, 282, 346). Hausa States Fulfulde is coded as 1 because even though the same marker is used for both meanings, its syntactic position differs for these two types of quantification.

GB250,Can predicative possession be expressed with a transitive 'habeo' verb?,"## Can predicative possession be expressed with a transitive ‘habeo’ verb?

## Summary
This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and a possessum. For this feature, we are looking for a verb that expresses predicative possession where the possessor is the subject, the possessum the object and the verb is finite and clearly transitive. The finite element in itself need not be clearly distinct from an existential or locational predicator, the main difference is the argument structure. 

Transitivity is a language-specific category that needs to be investigated separately to learn whether or not the construction is transitive. In case of languages where transitivity is hard to define it might be beneficial to compare to verbs of holding and grasping. It is very likely that habeo-verb constructions arise from possessive constructions where the possessor is expressed as a topic.

## Procedure
1. Find the section on predicative possession.
2. If no such section exists, search for words like ‘own’, ‘possess’, ‘have’ and ‘belong’.
3. If there is no information on how predicative possession is expressed in the language, code as ?.
4. If it is clear that there is a finite transitive verb where the subject is the possessor and the direct object the possessed, code as 1.
5. If there are multiple constructions besides this one to express predicative possession, code 1 for this feature and verify whether any of the other constructions are relevant to [GB252](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB252), [GB253](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB253), [GB254](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB254) or [GB256](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB256).

## Examples
**Swedish** (ISO 639-3: swe, Glottolog: swed1254)

Swedish is a Germanic language where predicate possession is expressed with a habeo-verb construction where the verb, *har*, is cognate with the the English habeo-verb *have*. Swedish is coded as 1 for this feature.

```
Andrea    har      en   bil
Andrea    have.PRS INDF car
‘Andrea has a car.’
```

## Summary
This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and possessum. This feature is concerned with clauses where the possessum is the subject of an existential/locative predicate and the possessor is in an oblique form marked by an element meaning ‘at/in/on’ (e.g. *the car is on me* to mean ‘I have a car.’ or ‘The car is mine.’). The possessor-NP need not be overtly marked for location, it can be expressed in the verb itself, e.g. with a locative extension. It is necessary for the construction that the possessor is not the subject.

This type of predicative possession construction is known as the ‘locational possessive’ in the work of Stassen (2001, 2013).

## Procedure

1. Find the section on predicative possession.
2. If no such section exists, search for words like ‘own’, ‘possess’, ‘have’ and ‘belong’.
3. If there is no information on how predicative possession is expressed in the language, code as ?.
4. If it is clear that there is a finite verb where the subject is the possessum and the possessor is coded as a location, code as 1.
5.

## Examples
**Ket** (ISO 639-3: ket, Glottolog: kett1243)

Ket is a language with an extensive case system. The adessive (ADESS) case is used both as a locative marker and to mark the possessor in a predicative possessive construction. The possessive verb is intransitive. Ket is coded as 1 for this feature.

```
ɔ́bdaŋt         bɔ́gdɔm  úsʲaŋ
ob-da-ŋt       bokdom  usaŋ

## Summary
This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and possessum. This feature concerns clauses where the possessum is the subject of an existential predicate and the possessor is coded as an oblique argument, marked by an element meaning ‘to/for’ or by a dative marker (e.g. *car is to me*, *car is for me*, meaning ‘The car is mine’, or ‘I have a car’). The possessor-NP need not be marked for dative case. The dative meaning can be expressed on the verb itself, e.g. with a benefactive extension.

This type of predicative possession construction is known as the ‘dative possessive’, a subcategory of the ‘locational possessive’, in the work of Stassen (2000, 2001, 2003).

## Procedure
1. Find the section on predicative possession.
2. If no such section exists, search for words like ‘own’, ‘possess’, ‘have’ and ‘belong’.
3. If there is no information on how predicative possession is expressed in the language, code as ?.
4. If it is clear that there is a finite verb where the subject is the possessum and the possessor is coded like a recipient/dative object/with elements meaning ‘to/for’, code as 1.

**Yucatec Maya** (ISO 639-3: yua, Glottolog: yuca1254)
In Yucatec Maya, there are possessive constructions where the possessor is in the dative case. Yucatec Maya is coded as a 1 for this feature. The verbs *yan* ‘to exist’ and *kabet* ‘to need’, a modal auxiliary, may express possession.

```
a. Yan   ten     uah.
   exist 1SG.DAT tortillas
   ‘I have tortillas.’ (Bolles & Bolles 2014: 116)

b. Kabet ten      uah.
   need  1SG.DAT  tortillas
   ‘I have tortillas.’ (Bolles & Bolles 2014: 116)
```

GB254,Can predicative possession be expressed with an S-like possessum and a possessor that is coded like an adnominal possessor?,"## Can predicative possession be expressed with an S-like possessum and a possessor that is coded like an adnominal possessor?

## Summary
This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and possessum. This feature concerns clauses where the possessum is the subject and the possessor is construed as a modifier of the possessum (e.g. *my car exists* to mean ‘I have a car’).

This type of predicative possessive construction is known as the ‘genitive possessive’ in the work of Stassen (2001, 2013).

## Procedure
1. Find the section on predicative possession.
2. If no such section exists, search for words like ‘own’, ‘possess’, ‘have’, and ‘belong’.
3. If there is no information on how predicative possession is expressed in the language, code as ?.
4. If it is clear that there is a clause type where a possessum is coded as a subject and the possessor is coded as a modifier of the subject, code as 1.
5. If there are multiple constructions besides this one to express predicative possession, code 1 for this feature and verify whether any of the other constructions are relevant to [GB250](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB250), [GB252](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB252), [GB253](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB253) or [GB256](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB256).

## Examples
**Rapa Nui** (ISO 639-3: rap, Glottolog: rapa1244)

In Rapa Nui, predicative possession is expressed by a clause stating the existence of the possessed noun. The possessor is encoded as a modifier of the noun. Rapanui is coded as 1 for this feature. In the example below, *'a* is the inalienable possessive marker that is also found in attributive possession.

```
E     ai    rō   ꞌā   te  kona ꞌoka   mahute  ꞌa    Kekepuē  ko    tetu 
IPFV  exist EMPH CONT ART place plant mulberry POSS Kekepue  EMPH  huge
‘Kekepue had a huge plantation of mulberries.’ (Kieviet 2017: 467),
```

GB256,Can predicative possession be expressed with an S-like possessor and a possessum that is coded like a comitative argument?,"## Can predicative possession be expressed with a comitative/conjunctional construction?

## Summary
This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. clauses that express an ownership relation between a possessor and a possessum. This feature concerns a clause which features a comitative/conjunctional construction (c.f. Stassen 2000, 2001, 2013). The predicate is an existential/locational/copula and the possessum or possessor is marked by an element marking simultaneity between clauses, or ‘also/too’, or subordinating conjunction (‘when/while’), or coordinating particle (‘and’), or a comitative marker (‘with’). The marker need not be [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). Both constructions where the possessor and constructions where the possessum is marked by the comitative marker count.

## Procedure
1. Find the section on predicative possession.
2. If no such section exists, search for words like ‘own’, ‘possess’, ‘have’ and ‘belong’.
3. If there is no information on how predicative possession is expressed in the language, code ?.
4. If it is clear that there is a productive finite clause type which meets the criteria above, code 1.
5. If there are multiple constructions besides this one to express predicative possession, code 1 for this feature and verify whether any of the other constructions are relevant to [GB250](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB250), [GB252](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB252), [GB253](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB253) or [GB254](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB254).

## Examples

**Marshallese** (ISO 639-3: mah, Glottolog: mars1254)

Marshallese has a marker for comitative, *ippā-*, that can express possessive predication. This is not well described in grammars of the language, but language specialist Jonathan Schlossberg was able to confirm to us over personal correspondence that this construction exists. He provided the example below. Marshallese is coded as a 1 for this feature.

``` 
e=pād             ippā-m̧ 
3SG.S=be.located  COM-2SG.P 
‘You have it.’ (lit. ‘It is with you.’)
```

GB257,Can polar interrogation be marked by intonation only?,"## Can polar interrogation be marked by intonation only?

## Summary
For this feature, we are looking for polar interrogation marked by intonation, and it should be the only marker in that construction. However, it does not have to be the only construction in the language which can mark polar interrogation. Intonation is our focus and not tone. Intonation is different from tonal marking. Tonal marking is bound to a certain position in the clause (e.g. the final syllable, or a certain constituent). Intonation concerns the whole clause and will have a variation in pitch across sentences and phrases.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a sentence can become a question by changing the intonation.
2. Code 0 if intonation and another marker (such as a question marker on the verb) together mark polar interrogation within the same construction. 
3. Code ? if it is not clear from limited data whether intonation marks polar interrogation in the language.

## Examples

**Marshallese** (ISO 639-3: mah, Glottolog: mars1254)

In Marshallese, polar interrogation can be indicated by either intonation alone in the construction, or by intonation and a clause-final question morpheme. Marshallese is coded 1 because intonation can be the only marker of polar interrogation in the construction.

```
Kwe    iro.i? 
2SG    chief? 
‘Are you a chief?’ (Zewen 1977: 92)
```

**Veps** (ISO 639-3: vep, Glottolog: veps1250) 

Coded 0. A question particle is obligatory which indicates that intonation (whether present or not) does not mark polar interrogation alone in the construction (Brodskij 2008: 33–34).

GB260,Can polar interrogation be indicated by a special word order?,"## Can polar interrogation be indicated by a special word order?

## Summary
Can a change in word order mark polar questions? In order for a construction to trigger 1, there should be no other marker in the clause that signals polar interrogation, not even lack of finiteness compared to the affirmative.  This excludes intonation, which may be different between questions and declarative statements.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a polar question can be formed by changing the word order in the clause and nothing else (except for intonation).
2.  Code 0 if a word order change and another marker (such as a question marker on the verb) together mark polar interrogation within the same construction. 
3. Code ? if it is not clear from limited data whether word order marks polar interrogation in the language.

## Examples

**Parecís** (ISO 639-3: pab, Glottolog: pare1272).

Coded 1. Generally, in polar questions, the focused questioned argument is fronted and the verb is clause-final (Brandão 2014: 338).

## Summary
In this feature, we are looking for a polar interrogative [particle](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles) that appears at the beginning of the clause. It is acceptable for a polar interrogative particle to appear in polar interrogatives and content questions, but the polar interrogative particle must be dedicated to marking questions that ask for the equivalent of an affirmative or negative answer (as opposed to content questions).

Dryer (2013) distinguishes **neutral** questions from **leading** questions in the paragraph quoted below. This feature in Grambank concerns neutral questions:

""Many languages have question particles or expressions that indicate that the question is a leading question, one where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. English, for example, employs what are called ""tag-questions"" for this purpose, illustrated in (13a), which differ from the neutral question form illustrated in (13b) in that its form indicates that the speaker expects a ‘yes’ answer.

13a. You’re planning to go to the beach, aren’t you? 

13b. Are you planning to go to the beach?""

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if polar interrogation can be marked through a dedicated phonologically free polar interrogative particle, 
2. And this particle appears at the beginning of the clause.
3. Code 0 if there are no polar interrogative particles or if the polar interrogative particle does not appear at the beginning of the clause.
 

## Examples

**Nyigina** (ISO 639-3: nyh, Glottocode:  nyig1240)

Coded 1. There is an interrogative particle for yes/no questions. The particle almost always occurs in the first position of a clause.

```

## Summary

Is there a [particle](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles) that is dedicated to marking questions that ask for the equivalent of a 'yes’ or 'no’ answer (as opposed to content questions) that most commonly occurs in the middle of the clause, neither initially nor finally?

GB265,"Is there a comparative construction that includes a form that elsewhere means 'surpass, exceed'?","## Is there a comparative construction that includes a form that elsewhere means ‘surpass, exceed’?

## Summary
This feature identifies languages that have a comparative construction that involves a form (usually a verb form) meaning ‘surpass’ or ‘exceed’. Typically, the standard of comparison is the direct object, the object of comparison is the subject, and there are two predicates: one expressing ‘surpass/exceed’, and one carrying relevant lexical information about the property under comparison (e.g. *Ronald exceed be-tall Julia.*, meaning ‘Ronald is taller than Julia.’). 

Though this typical structure is quite common in languages that have a ‘surpass/exceed’ comparative construction, only the use of a ‘surpass/exceed' form is required for this feature; it is not necessary for the standard to occur as a direct object or the thing being compared to serve as the subject in order to trigger a 1 value. The order of these predicates is not relevant for this feature, nor whether the property word is a verb or an adjective. The predicate expressing ‘surpass/exceed’ must also have functions besides comparison.

## Procedure
1. If the language has a comparative construction involving a form that is also used outside of comparative constructions and has a meaning of ‘surpass/exceed’, then code 1.
2. If the language does not use a ‘surpass/exceed’ form, code 0.
3. If the language uses a form that has a meaning of ‘surpass’ or ‘exceed’, but that form only occurs in comparative constructions (i.e. is never used without another predicate that contributes lexical information about a property under comparison), code 0.

## Examples
**Awtuw** (ISO 639-3: kmn, Glottolog: awtu1239)

In Awtuw there are comparative clauses that are constructed using the verb *eryer* ‘surpass’ in the second clause. This verb means ‘surpass’ outside of comparative constructions. Awtuw is coded 1.

```
rey   lælal  də-k-rokw-ey,       yaw d-eryer-kay
3SG.M noise  FACT-IPFV-do-IPFV   pig FACT-surpass-PRF
‘He makes more noise than a pig.’ (Feldman 1986: 169)
```

GB266,Is there a comparative construction that employs a marker of the standard which elsewhere has a locational meaning?,"## Is there a comparative construction that employs a marker of the standard which elsewhere has a locational meaning?

## Summary
This feature identifies comparative constructions that mark the standard of comparison with an element that is otherwise locational or benefactive in meaning. In these constructions a marker that also has a locational (or benefactive) function is invariably found in the standard NP. Please note that benefactive markers are included here, following Stassen’s (1984, 1985) category of locational comparatives. The marker of the property word is irrelevant for this feature (e.g. the English *-er* suffix, as in *tall-er*).

## Procedure
1. If there is a comparative construction in which the standard of comparison is marked with an element that has a locational meaning in non-comparative contexts, code 1.
2. If there is a comparative construction that uses a standard marker that otherwise has a benefactive meaning, code 1.
3. If there is no comparative construction that uses an element that elsewhere has a locational or benefactive meaning, code 0.

## Examples
**Egyptian Arabic** (ISO 639-3: arz, Glottolog: egyp1253)

The particle *min* (glossed as ‘than’), which otherwise functions as a preposition meaning ‘from’, can be used to form a comparative (Abdel-Massih 1979, 25-26) in Egyptian Arabic. Egyptian Arabic is coded 1.

GB270,Can comparatives be expressed using two conjoined clauses?,"## Can comparatives be expressed using two conjoined clauses?

## Summary
Is there a comparative construction comprised of two conjoined clauses? Specifically, this construction must involve two conjoined clauses, one containing the standard of comparison and one containing the object of comparison, with no additional, obligatory, special markers of comparison (e.g. English *than*, or *surpass/exceed*). The NPs expressing the standard and object of comparison typically have the same function in the clauses. Note that many languages can juxtapose clauses (e.g. English *She is nice and he is not nice.*), however these sorts of constructions should only be considered for this feature when they are a dedicated way of expressing comparative meaning (e.g. when the structure clearly has a meaning like, ‘She is nicer than he is.’). In other words, we are focused on languages that have a dedicated comparative construction involving conjoined clauses.

## Procedure
1. If the language has a dedicated comparative construction that involves two conjoined clauses, with the NPs expressing the standard and object of comparison functioning similarly in separate clauses, code 1.
2. If the language can conjoin clauses in which an object of comparison and the standard of comparison function in similar roles, but this is not a dedicated comparative construction, code 0.
3. If the language cannot express comparison through the use of two conjoined clauses as described above, code 0.

## Examples

**Nukna** (ISO 639-3: klt, Glottolog: nukn1238)

Comparison in Nukna is not expressed with comparative words like English *more* or *bigger*. Instead, juxtaposition of clauses can be used. Nukna is coded 1.
```
Siang=ku   mulangán  sim       hang  Supsungan=ku   enanggon
Siang=TOP  far.away  somewhat  and   Supsungan=TOP  nearby
‘Siang is farther away than Supasungan.’ (Taylor 2015: 240)
```

**Lowland Tarahumara** (ISO 639-3: tac, Glottolog: lowl1265)

Comparatives can be formed by juxtaposing two clauses in Lowland Tarahumara. Lowland Tarahumara is coded 1.
```
migéli wé   a'lá rió hú húlio ta'mé 'la  rió hú  
Miguel very good man be Julio NEG   good man be  
‘Miguel is a better man than Julio.’ (Burgess 1984: 98)
```

**Hano** (ISO 639-3: lml, Glottolog: hano1246)

In Hano comparative statements of quality, property, or action of NPs are expressed through juxtaposed clauses, without any overt comparative markers. Hano is coded 1.
```
Jason n̄ava Turi vweluwele
Jason tall Turi short
‘Jason is tall, Turi is short.’ OR ‘Jason is taller than Turi.’ (Vari-Bogiri 2011: 142)

La  vanua,  vol-vol mamara, Vila vol-vol marahi
LOC village buy-buy light,  Vila buy-buy heavy
‘It is cheap in the village, it is expensive in Vila.’ 
OR ‘It is cheaper in the village than in Vila.’ (Vari-Bogiri 2011: 142)
```

GB273,Is there a comparative construction with a standard marker that elsewhere has neither a locational meaning nor a 'surpass/exceed' meaning?,"## Is there a comparative construction with a standard marker that elsewhere has neither a locational meaning nor a ‘surpass/exceed’ meaning?

## Summary
This question is focused on comparative constructions that have a dedicated marker for the standard of comparison that does not fall under the umbrella of the locational comparative ([GB266](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB266)) or surpass/exceed comparative ([GB265](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB265)). Note that a language may have multiple comparative constructions, including a non-locational, non-surpass/exceed comparative as well as constructions that are described by those features.

Crucially, the dedicated marker in this construction must not elsewhere have a surpass/exceed meaning or a locational meaning. It may, however, have other functions (e.g. temporal adverb, conjunction, etc.). It is irrelevant whether this marker is [phonologically free or not](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) or whether it triggers [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) in case, noun class, etc. 

Historically, comparative constructions with dedicated markers (sometimes called ‘particle comparatives’) grammaticalize from constructions of conjoined clauses. An example of a particle comparative would be the Germanic languages, such as English *than*. Note that any marking of the property word is not relevant here (e.g. English *tall-er*).

## Procedure
1. If the language has a comparative construction with a dedicated marker of the standard of comparison that does not elsewhere have a surpass/exceed meaning or a locational meaning, code 1.
2. If the language has comparative constructions with dedicated markers, but only constructions with markers that elsewhere have surpass/exceed or locational meanings, code 0.
3. If the language has no comparative constructions with dedicated markers to identify the standard of comparison, code 0.

## Examples
**Gilbertese** (ISO 639-3: gil, Glottolog: gilb1244)

Gilbertese forms comparative constructions using the form *nakon*, which means ‘than’ and does not have a more general locational or surpass/exceed meaning.

```
e  rietaata riki te  nii            nakon te  kaina 
it tall     more ART cococnut.tree  than  ART pandanus.tree
‘The coconut tree is taller than the pandanus tree.’  
(Groves et al. 1985: 69; glosses partly derived from Bingham 1908)
```

Gilbertese is coded as 1 because the form that marks the standard of comparison in this example has neither a locational meaning nor a surpass exceed meaning. The fact that this marker is used in at least some comparatives is sufficient to trigger a 1 for this feature, regardless of whether there are other comparative constructions that employ markers with locational or surpass/exceed meanings (as it happens, there is no evidence for these other types of comparative markers in Gilbertese).

GB275,Is there a bound comparative degree marker on the property word in a comparative construction?,"## Is there a bound comparative degree marker on the property word in a comparative construction?

## Summary
This feature focuses on the presence of a bound marker of comparative degree on the property word in a comparative construction (e.g. *-er* in English *tall-er*). We specifically focus on comparative constructions where the standard of comparison is overtly expressed (e.g. *Maria is taller than John.*) but also count clearly comparative forms where the standard of comparison is null/implied/inferred from context (e.g. *Maria is taller.*) This feature requires the degree marker to be [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) to the property word.

## Procedure
1. If there is a degree marker that is bound to the property word in a comparative construction, code 1.
2. If there is a degree marker in comparative constructions, but it is not bound to the property word, code 0.
3. If there is no degree marker in comparative constructions, code 0.

## Examples
**Achumawi** (ISO 639-3: acv, Glottolog: achu1247)

Achumawi forms a comparative by suffixing *-wáqtsè* or *-máqtsè* to a property word.

```
wà'wá-máqtsè  qà   town  Alturas-ú-wádé  
big-CMPR      the  town  Alturas-of-at  
‘This is a bigger town than Alturas.’ (de Angulo & Freeland 1930: 86)
```

Because this degree marker is bound to the property word in an Achumawi comparative construction, the language is coded 1.

GB276,Is there a non-bound comparative degree marker modifying the property word in a comparative construction?,"## Is there a non-bound comparative degree marker modifying the property word in a comparative construction?

## Summary
This feature focuses on the presence of a [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) marker of comparative degree that modifies the property word in a comparative construction (e.g. French ***plus** grand*). We specifically focus on comparative constructions where the standard of comparison is overtly expressed (e.g. meanings like ‘Maria is taller than John’) but also count clearly comparative forms where the standard of comparison is null/implied/inferred from the context (e.g. meanings like ‘Maria is taller’). The comparative constructions of interest express superiority (as in the French and English examples above), not inferiority (e.g. meanings like ‘John is less athletic than Maria’).

This feature requires that the degree marker modify the property word. It should not be phonologically bound.

## Procedure
1. If there is a degree marker expressing superiority in a comparative construction that modifies the property word and is not phonologically bound, code 1.
2. If there is a degree marker expressing superiority in comparative constructions, but any such markers are bound to the property word, code 0.
3. If the only phonologically free degree markers in the language expresses something other than superiority (e.g. inferiority), code 0.
3. If there is no degree marker in comparative constructions, code 0.

## Examples
**Miskito** (ISO 639-3: miq, Glottolog: misk1235)

A comparative construction expressing superiority in Miskito uses the phonologically independent property word/degree marker *kau*.

```
gul  ba  kau  mana      sa  aian wal  
gold the SUPL expensive is  iron than  
‘Gold is more expensive than iron.’ (CIDCA 1985: 80)
```

Miskito is coded 1 because the degree marker used in this comparative construction satisfies both the phonological independence and superiority meaning criteria. This language uses other degree markers for comparisons of inferiority, but those do not impact the coding of this feature.

GB285,Can polar interrogation be marked by a question particle and verbal morphology?,"## Can polar interrogation be marked by a question particle and verbal morphology?

## Summary
For this feature, we are looking for polar interrogation marked by a question [particle](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles) and verbal [morphology](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). These should be the only two markers in the construction. However, this does not have to be the only construction in the language which can mark polar interrogation. Nominalizers also count as verbal morphology for the purpose of this question. Tone does not count as a particle here. The intonation of the clause is not relevant to this question. It may be the same as or different from declarative clauses.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if questions can be formed by a construction that has a phonologically independent marker and an additional morpheme on the verb (which does not have to be entirely dedicated to question marking).
2. Nothing else may be different between the polar question and the declarative statement, apart from intonation. 
3. Code 0 If the grammar mentions other polar interrogative constructions, but does not contain a discussion of interrogative verbal morphology and interrogative particles.
4. Code ? if the grammar does not treat polar interrogation at all.

## Examples

**Coahuilteco** (ISO 639-3: xcw, Glottolog: coah1252)

Coded 1. Past tense truth value (yes/no) questions are usually marked by a verbal enclitic *-(y)am* plus the interrogative particle *e*.
 
```
mame·yna·koyam  e·?

2SG-think-PST   Q
‘Have you thought?’ (Troike 1996: 655)
```

**Gata** (ISO 639-3: gaq, Glottolog: gata1239)
 
Coded 1. Gata can use an interrogative verbal suffix and the interrogative pronoun *mae* ‘what’ to form polar interrogatives. (Ashirvadam 1992: 260–262)
```
mae  bole   cagd-e’     mae ?

GB286,Can polar interrogation be indicated by overt verbal morphology only?,"## Can polar interrogation be indicated by overt verbal morphology only?

## Summary

In order for a construction to trigger 1, there should be no other **marker** in the clause that signals polar interrogation, not even lack of finiteness compared to the affirmative. This excludes intonation, which may be different between questions and declarative statements. Please note, GB286 need not need be the only polar interrogative **construction** in the language to code 1. It may still be possible to code 1 for other constructions alongside this one, such as [GB285,](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB285/) [GB262,](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB262/) [GB263,](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB263/) [GB264.](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB264/)



## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a polar question can be formed by adding a morpheme that is phonologically bound to the verb (or by suppletion).
2. Nothing else may be different between the polar question and the declarative statement, apart from intonation. 
3. Code 0 If the grammar mentions other polar interrogative constructions, but does not contain a discussion of interrogative verbal morphology.
4. Code ? if the grammar does not treat polar interrogation at all.

## Examples

**Fuyug** (ISO 639-3: fuy, Glottolog: fuyu1242)

Fuyug is coded 1. The following is an example of a construction that triggers 1. 

```
Nu  ge  yalov ongo  n-adi=a?
1SG TOP food  some  eat-IRR=Q
‘Are you going to eat some food?’ (Bradshaw 2007: 66)
```

GB291,Can polar interrogation be marked by tone?,"## Can polar interrogation be marked by tone?

## Summary
This feature deals with the presence or absence of a construction where the only difference between the interrogative and the declarative is marked by tone. Please note that tone is the focus here, not intonation. Tonal marking is bound to a certain position in the clause (e.g. the final syllable, or a certain constituent). Intonation concerns the whole clause and will have a variation in pitch across sentences and phrases.

## Procedure

1) Determine if there is lexical or grammatical tone in the language (other than for polar interrogation)
2) if so, and if one of the words in a declarative sentence can change its tone to change the sentence into a polar question then code 1.

## Examples



**Afar** (ISO 639-3: aar, Glottolog: afar1241) Coded 1:

""Consultative can be derived as a question form of subjunctive in which an underlying *o* is not raised to *u* because of the addition of the question length and tone marker."" (Bliese 1977: 148–151)
```
’ab-u ‘that I do it’ (subjunctive from ab’aa-o) 
a’b-oô ‘shall I do it?’ (consultative from ab’aa-oô) (Bliese 1977: 149)

GB296,Is there a phonologically or morphosyntactically definable class of ideophones that includes ideophones depicting imagery beyond sound?,"## Is there a phonologically or morphosyntactically definable class of ideophones that includes ideophones depicting imagery beyond sound?

## Summary

Ideophones are marked words that depict sensory imagery, e.g. *glimmer*, *twiddle*, *tinkle*. In some languages, ideophones may have different morphosyntactic characteristics from other word classes (e.g. they have different morphology, or they have no morphology at all while other classes do; or they may be extremely free when it comes to word order, in comparison to other words). They may also feature sounds that are not present anywhere else in the language. Every language probably has ideophones, but not every language has a very well defined class of ideophones.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions ideophone-specific phonological or morphosyntactic characteristics, and gives examples of ideophones indicating imagery beyond sound.
2. Code 1 if a source mentions ideophones (beyond sound) and you can identify morphosyntactic or phonological properties that do not seem to apply to other word classes (e.g. word order, morphology).
3. Code 0 if a source mentions ideophones (beyond sound) but classifies them together with another word class morphosyntactically and does not mention specific phonological characteristics.
4. Code 0 if an otherwise comprehensive description does not mention ideophones.
5. Code 0 if only ideophones depicting auditory imagery are attested.
6. Code ? if you have reason to believe that the sources missed ideophones depicting imagery beyond sound or specific properties of ideophones in the language.

## Examples

**Ewe** (ISO 639-3: ewe, Glottolog: ewee1241)

Ideophones in Ewe have (at least) three unusual phonological characteristics (Ameka 1991: 78):

* They can have short or long vowels without any change in meaning.
* Tone may be used sound-symbolically, so tone in ideophones is arguably more fluid.
* Syllables of ideophones may be reversed:

```
nyadsii - drinyaa ‘tough, hard’
kpɔdzɔɔ - dzɔkpɔɔ ‘fat, thick’
tsaklii - klitsaa ‘rough’
nogoo   - gonoo ‘round’
```

Ewe is coded 1 for this feature.

**Buwal** (ISO 639-3: bhs, Glottolog: buwa1243)

In Viljoen’s (2013: 67-70) grammar of Buwal, six phonologically uncommon characteristics of ideophones are discussed:

1. Changes in pitch, or lack of a clearly associated melody (cf. Ewe), e.g. *jāàȁȁ* ‘noise of rain’
2. Long vowels and consonants, which do not occur often elsewhere (cf. Ewe), e.g. *fɐ́ːɾɐ́* ‘manner of running slowly’, *mbɛ̀ɮːɛ́* ‘manner of staring fixedly’
3. Exaggerated aspiration, e.g. *pʰoe̋hʷ* ‘noise of sudden entry or exit’
4. In other word classes, palatalized vowels only occur with front vowels, but in ideophones, they can also occur with non-front vowels: *kə̋tʃɐ̋ kə́tʃɐ́ kə̄tʃɐ̄ kə̀tʃɐ̀* ‘cry of guinea fowl’
5. In other word classes, rounded vowels are typically found next to labialized velar consonants or labial-velar /w/. In ideophones, they are also found next to other consonants: *bőf* ‘come out suddenly’, *ɐ̀túl* ‘manner of smoke ascending’
6. /ə/ and its allophones do not usually occur in final syllables, but they do in ideophones: *bɪm̋* ‘noise of sudden digging’, *ɐ̀túl* ‘manner of smoke ascending’

One morphosyntactic characteristic of ideophones in Buwal is repetition or reduplication to a greater extent than in other word classes, e.g. *ŋɡɐ̄m ŋɡɐ̀m ŋɡɐ̄m ŋɡɐ̀m* ‘noise of grinding’.

Buwal is coded 1 for this feature.

**Luchazi** (ISO 639-3: lch, Glottolog: luch1239)

For Luchazi, Fleisch (2000: 45) states that ideophones feature consonant clusters and sounds that do not occur in other parts of speech. He does not, however, provide examples, but this statement is enough to warrant a 1 for this feature in Grambank.

**Bangi** (ISO 639-3: bni, Glottolog: bang1354)

Whitehead (1899) discusses a class of sound-symbolic ‘indeclinable adjectives’ in Bangi (in his words: ""they may be traced to an onomatopoetic origin"", they are ""colouring"" words"" (Whitehead 1899: 18).

These ideophones are grammatically characterized by a lack of noun class agreement and person indexing, which applies to verbs, other adjectives, and nouns. Bangi is coded 1 for this feature.

```
ca          ‘scattered’
kākatanu    ‘puzzling’
kō-kō       ‘tied up’
tī          ‘intent, still, cool’
zölôlô      ‘whirling’
```

**Chinook** (ISO 639-3: cch, Glottolog: chin1286) 

Similarly to Whitehead for Bangi, Boas (1911: 627) describes a class of words in Chinook of ""onomatopoetic origin"" that do not require pronominal indexes.

Chinook is coded 1 for this feature.

GB297,Can polar interrogation be indicated by a V-not-V construction?,"## Can polar interrogation be indicated by a V-not-V construction?

## Summary
This feature concerns polar interrogative constructions where the main verb is repeated, once in the affirmative form and again in the negated form, as a pragmatically unmarked way of asking questions. The negated form can also occur before the affirmative form.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if there is a construction where the main verb is repeated, one time in the affirmative form and another in the negated, to form a polar question.  This should be pragmatically unmarked, e.g. equivalent to English ‘Did you go?’, rather than the English form ‘Did you go or not?’ (which is used e.g. when repeating the question).
2. Code 0 if there is information on how questions are formed, and this structure is not listed among them.
3. Code ? if there is not enough information on how questions are formed.

GB298,"Can standard negation be marked by an inflecting word (""auxiliary verb"")?","## Can standard negation be marked by an inflecting word (‘auxiliary verb’)?

## Summary
This feature refers to Standard Negation, i.e. the constructions that mark negation of (at least) dynamic (not-stative) verbal predicates in declarative mood. This question aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) markers that inflect (i.e. change form depending on TAM, person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These inflecting phonologically free markers are often described as ‘auxiliary verbs’ in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels by some authors (such as STAMP morphemes (STAM = Subject-Tense-Aspect-Mood-Polarity) or inflecting pronouns). We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory marking](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness). 

## Procedure
1. Find the section in the available descriptive literature that deals with negation.
2. If you do not find any negation markers that inflect, code as 0.
3. If an inflecting word clearly marks negation, code the language as 1.
4. If it is not clear whether the inflecting word marks negation, code the language as ?.

## Examples
**Finnish** (ISO 639-3: fin, Glottolog: finn1318)

Standard negation in Finnish is expressed with a negative auxiliary followed by the inflectional stem of the main verb. The form of the auxiliary varies according to the person and number of the subject (Karlsson 1999: 69–70). Finnish is coded 1 for this feature.

```

GB300,Does the verb for 'give' have suppletive verb forms?,"## Does the verb for ‘give’ have suppletive verb forms?

## Summary
This question concerns strong suppletion in verbs of giving. Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. So called ‘weak’ suppletion is not included. An example of this is English _went_ and _go_. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. 

## Procedure
1. Look up the section on ditransitive verbs.
2. If no such section exists, search for the words ‘give’ and ‘receive’.
3. If the verb paradigm for ‘give’ is not described, code as ?.
4. If the verb ‘give’ is described as being non-variant in any way, code as 0.
5. If the verb ‘give’ is strongly suppletive anywhere, code as 1.

## Examples
**Tongan** (ISO 639-3: ton, Glottolog: tong1325)

In Tongan ‘give’ is expressed with the words _mai_ and _atu_ for *give towards speaker* and *give away from speaker* respectively (Churchward 1985: 20–21). The forms are very different from each other but both express the meaning ‘give' and the difference is in direction. Hence, they count as suppletion. Tongan is coded 1 for this feature.

## Summary
We are looking for a construction where a nonsingular referent is expressed by a nonsingular form (superset) and a singular form (subset). The element expressing the superset could be either [a free pronoun, an index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or a plural noun/proper noun. 
An example: in ***We Harald** talked* ‘Harald and I talked.’, the free 1PL pronoun *we* is a superset, and included within that is the subset which is the 1SG referent (the ‘I’ in the translation) and the proper noun *Harald*. In some languages, this construction may involve associative duals and plurals. This feature includes implicit inclusory constructions (as seen above) and explicit inclusory constructions which may have an overt inclusory marker in the construction to further mark the inclusory construction. The subset can be expressed with different word classes such as proper nouns, numerals, demonstratives, etc. Inclusory constructions often take the form of nominal coordination constructions.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if coordination can be denoted by a non-singular superset (free or bound) and a singular form (a noun, or various word classes) that is being included in the larger group.
2. Code 1 if there are inclusory constructions which are marked by comitative markers. 
4. Code 1 if there is a non-singular full noun inclusory form rather than a pronoun, and mention this in the comments. 
5. Code ? if you are unable to determine from the grammar or example data whether there is an inclusory construction.
6. Code 0 only if within a very extensive grammar the author does not discuss inclusory constructions and if it can be determined absent from a large set of example data.

## Examples

**Nanggu** (ISO 639-3: ngr, Glottolog: nang1262) 

Coded 1. In Nanggu the comitative marker marks the included participant: it ""indicates a co-actor to the agent expressed by the verb."" The comitative ""occurs with free augmented pronouns or verbs that express augmented number of the subject."" The comitative below takes a third person minimal marker (Vaa 2013: 210–214).

```
Nege     pa-ngolopli-ti-gâ                          ma-e       matu.
today    IPFV:N3AUG.S/A:CAUS-decorate-TR-1AUG.S/A   with-3MIN  house
‘Today, we two decorate the house.’ (Vaa 2013: 211)
```

**Marghi Central** (ISO 639-3: mrt, Glottolog: marg1265)

Coded 1. Haspelmath (2007) gives the following example as the first and only language (at the time of writing) he has found which does not use a non-singular pronoun as the inclusory superset, but a non-singular proper noun marked with an associative plural form.

```
a. kàmbə̀ràwázhá-yàr  àgá  màlà  gə́ndà
   Kamburawazha-APL  with wife  of.him
   ‘Kamburawazha and his wife’ (Hoffmann 1963: 57)
```

Central Marghi also has the more widely found inclusory construction with a non-singular inclusory pronoun marking the superset.
```
b. nà'y àgá  Mádù 
   we   with Madu
   ‘Madu and I’ (Hoffmann 1963: 238)
```

**Tamasheq** (ISO 639-3: taq, Glottolog: tama1365)

Coded 0. The author calls the plural agreement marker *næɤ* in the following example an ""inclusory pronominal clitic"", but the nominal subset exhausts the potential referents and does not count as an inclusory construction. The nonsingular form (superset) is *-næɤ* ‘us’, and the singular forms (subset) are *nækk ə̀d kæyy* ‘me and you’ (Heath 2005: 702–705).
```
i-nhæ̀y-\ɑ-næɤ               [nækk  ə̀d   kæyy]
3SG.M-see.PFV.AFF-\O-1PL     1Sg   with 2.M.SG
‘He saw us, me and you.’ (Heath 2005: 703)
```

## Summary

Passivization is a valency reducing operation that takes a transitive clause (*The dog bites the man.*) and turns it into an intransitive clause by promoting the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the man*) to morphosyntactic [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) function. In the resulting intransitive clause, the former [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the dog*) either vanishes or adopts an oblique function: *The man is bitten (by the dog).* ‘Mediopassives’, ‘anticausatives’ and the sort (e.g. *x breaks the vase* > *the vase breaks*) also count as passives. This question targets [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) particles or auxiliaries marking passive clauses. 

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions a phonologically independent morpheme to mark passive clauses. This can be a particle or an auxiliary.    
2. Code 1 if there is no information on phonological (in)dependence but the relevant passivizing marker (auxiliary or particle) is not orthographically bound to the verb. Add a comment that your analysis is based on orthography.
3. Code 1 if you identify a phonologically free passive marker in the examples/texts provided in a source.
4. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no passive.  
5. Code 0 if a source mentions a verb-coded passive (i.e. one that is marked on the verb by a phonologically bound element) or other means of passivization, but no passive marked with a particle or auxiliary.  
6. Code 0 if a grammar treats other valency changing operations in considerable depth but does not mention passive constructions.
7. Code ? if there are examples that contain a potential passivizing construction but their analysis remains inconclusive.  
8. Code ? if there are no sources treating valency changing operations in the language or if treatment of them is very limited.  

## Examples

**Jamaican** (ISO 639-3: jam, Glottolog: jama1262)

In Jamaican, the particle *get* functions as a passive marker. Jamaican is coded 1.

```
Op   tu   nou   dem   no     nuo    ou   di    fuud    get     kuk.
up   to   now   3PL   NEG    know   how  DET   food    PASS    cook
‘Even now they still don't know how the food was cooked.’ (Farquharson 2013: 86)
```

**Udihe** (ISO 639-3: ude, Glottolog: udih1248)

Udihe passives are formed with a phonologically bound suffix *-u-*, and thus count for 0 coding of this feature:

```
si      min-du   gida-si-u-zeŋe-i
you     me-DAT   spear-V-PAS-FUT-2SG
‘You will be killed by me.’ (Nikolaeva & Tolskaya 2001: 572–582)
```

**Bongili** (ISO 639-3: bui, Glottolog: bong1284)

Bongili is described by Mangulu (2008: 30) as marking passive through a word order change. 
>""Le passif est rendu ... par l'antéposition du patient avec ou sans pronominalisation redondante..."" (Mangulu 2008: 30). 

Bongili is coded 0 for this feature.

```
a. Active:
   ɓa-bom-ák-á            moto   yáná
   3PL-kill-PST-DIST.PST  man    yesterday
   ‘They killed a man yesterday.’ (Mangulu 2008: 30)

b. Passive:
   moto    ɓa-bom-ák-á            yáná
   man     3PL-kill-PST-DIST.PST  yesterday
   ‘A man was killed yesterday.’ (Mangulu 2008: 30)
```

**Kuku-Uwanh** (ISO 639-3: uwa, Glottolog: kuku1280)

For Kuku-Uwanh, Smith & Johnson (2000) explicitly state that there is no grammatical passive. This language is coded as 0:

> ""Nganhcara lacks passive or antipassive constructions. Free word order and the optional omission of constituents allows Nganhcara to achieve the discourse functions of these formations without morphological apparatus"" (Smith & Johnson 2000: 425).

## Summary

An antipassive marker detransitivizes verbs by removing the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument or realizing it as an oblique. In a construction with ergative alignment, this means that the [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument of a transitive clause is encoded as the [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument in a corresponding antipassive clause. An antipassive marker often also has other detransitivizing functions, such as reflexivization, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative. In practice, this feature targets any intransitivizing marker that is not, or not only, a reflexive, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative marker. This question targets [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) particles or auxiliaries marking antipassive clauses. 

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions a phonologically independent antipassive marker. This can be a particle or an auxiliary.    
2. Code 1 if there is no information on phonological (in)dependence but the relevant antipassive marker (auxiliary or particle) is not orthographically bound to the verb. Add a comment that your analysis is based on orthography.
3. Code 1 if you identify a phonologically free antipassive marker in the examples/texts provided in a source.
4. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no antipassive.  
5. Code 0 if a source mentions a phonologically bound antipassive marker or other means of marking antipassives, but not one marked with a particle or auxiliary.  
6. Code 0 if a grammar treats other valency changing operations in considerable depth but does not mention antipassive constructions.
7. Code ? if there are examples that contain a potential antipassive construction but their analysis remains inconclusive.  
8. Code ? if there are no sources treating valency changing operations in the language or if treatment of them is very limited.  

## Examples

**Movima** (ISO-639-3: mzp, Glottolog: movi1243)

Movima has a preverbal antipassive particle, variably realized as *kaw* or *kwey* (Haude 2006: 287). The *kaw*-construction places the agent of the clause in a focus position and codes the undergoer as oblique. Movima is coded 1.

In the following examples, the agent (‘he’) is expressed as an enclitic (*=us*, absential masculine) in the transitive clause and the undergoer (‘the glass’) is unmarked for case. In the antipassive construction, the agent is expressed with a free pronoun (*usko*, ‘he’) and the undergoer is marked as oblique on the article (*n-as*).

```
a. bay-a-cho=us            as        waːso
   knock-DIR-inside=M.AST  ART.NEUT  glass
   ‘He has broken the glass.’ (Haude 2006: 287)

b. usko    kwey    bay-aː-cho       n-as          waːso
   3SG.M   ANTIP   knock-DIR-inside OBL-ART.NEUT  glass
   ‘He has broken the glass.’ (Haude 2006: 287)

(Abbreviations: AST absential)
```

**Kuku Yalanji** (ISO 639-3: gvn, Glottolog: kuku1273)	

Kuku Yalanji has ergative alignment of case marking on nouns. It also has an antipassive suffix, *-ji*. In the active clause below, the A argument (‘the man’) is marked with ergative case. In the antipassive clause, it is coded with absolutive case, like an S argument. The former absolutive argument (P) is coded as a location in the antipassive clause. Because the antipassive marker is bound and it is the only antipassive marker in Kuku Yalanji, the language is coded 0.	

Note that the alignment pattern of case marking is accusative for pronouns, so non-pronominal A arguments are marked with ergative case, while pronominal A arguments are marked with nominative case.	

```	
a. Active clause:
   nyulu      dingkar-angka    minya        nuka-ny
   3SG.NOM(A) man-ERG:PT(A)    meat.ABS(P)  eat-PST
   ‘The man ate meat.’ (Patz 2002: 152)

b. Antipassive clause:
   nyulu       dingkar      minya-nga    nuka-ji-ny
   3SG.NOM(S)  man.ABS(S)   meat-LOC     eat-ANTIP-PST
   ‘The man had a good feed of meat (he wasted nothing.)’ (Patz 2002: 152)

(Abbreviations: PT potent case)
```

## Summary
Passivization is a detransitivizing operation that takes a transitive clause (*The dog bites the man.*) and turns it into an intransitive clause by promoting the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the man*) to morphosyntactic [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) function. In the resulting intransitive clause, the former [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the dog*) either vanishes or adopts an oblique function: *The man is bitten (by the dog).* ‘Mediopassives’, ‘anticausatives’ and the sort (e.g. *x breaks the vase* > *the vase breaks*) also count as passives. For languages with multiple passive constructions (e.g. ‘personal’ and ‘impersonal’ passives), this question should be answered 1 if the agent can be overtly expressed in any of these types of passive clauses. If the agent is overtly expressed, it may be unmarked or it may be marked in a number of ways: by case marking or adpositions, word order, etc.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if you find an example of a passive clause that has an overtly expressed agent.
2. Code 0 if a grammar explicitly states that agents cannot be overtly expressed in passive clauses.
3. Code 0 if a grammar contains a lot of examples of passive clauses, but no examples where there’s an overtly expressed agent.
4. Code 0 if the language does not have a morphosyntactic passive (expressed by means of word order, particles, auxiliaries, affixes, clitics).
5. Code ? if it is unclear whether the language has a morphosyntactic passive.
6. Code ? if you do not have enough data to say that it is impossible to express an agent in a passive clause (e.g. because it is not mentioned or because there are not many examples of passive clauses in the grammar).

## Examples

**Zuni** (ISO 639-3: zun, Glottolog: zuni1245)

Zuni does not allow the addition of an agent role to a passive clause (Nichols 1997: 126) and is coded 0.

```
a. hom       nicikya     'uk-na-'kya
   1SG.ACC   ring        give-PASS-PST
   ‘I was given a ring.’ (Nichols 1997: 126)

b. *tom       'an   hom       nicikya     'uk-na-'kya
   2SG.ACC    P     1SG.ACC   ring        give-PASS-PST
   ‘I was given a ring by you.’ (Nichols 1997: 126)

c. *tom      'akkya     hom       nicikya   'uk-na-'kya
   2SG.ACC   with       1SG.ACC   ring      give-PASS-PST
   ‘I was given a ring by you.’ (Nichols 1997: 126)
```

**Liko** (ISO 639-3: lik, Glottolog: lika1243)

De Wit (2015: 374–375) describes a neutro-passive construction in Liko, which appears to be a passive construction that does not allow an overtly expressed agent. Because the agent cannot be expressed, he argues that this construction is not a true passive. Elsewhere, he concludes that there is no passive in Liko (De Wit 2015: 410–414). The neutro-passive *does* qualify as a passive for the purpose of Grambank, however, and the fact that the agent cannot occur with the neutro-passive triggers a 0 for this feature.

Some examples of the neutro-passive derivation, with *-ɩ́k* in Liko:

```
ká-nʊw-á ‘to tear’     → ká-nʊw-ɩ́k-á ‘to tear, intransitive’
kó-ɓún-ó ‘to break’    → kó-ɓún-ík-ó ‘to break, intransitive’
```

**Raji** (ISO 639-3: rji, Glottolog: raji1240)

Raji has a passive suffix, *-i*. Passive constructions allow the expression of the agent marked with ablative case (Khatri 2008: 27). Raji is coded 1 for this feature.

```
a. ram-ɦatiŋ     bʌtaŋ    dza–i–k-a
   Ram-ABL       rice     eat-PASS-SD-PST
   ‘Rice was eaten by Ram.’ (Khatri 2008: 27)

b. ram-ɦatiŋ     bʰwa    sʌtika
   Ram-ABL       bird    kill-PASS-SD-PST
   ‘The bird was killed by Ram.’ (Khatri 2008: 27)

GB305,Is there a phonologically independent reflexive pronoun?,"## Is there a phonologically independent reflexive marker?

## Summary

Reflexive markers indicate that a participant is coreferential with another participant in the clause or sentence (cf. Haspelmath & The APiCS Consortium 2013). A reflexive marker can be derived from pronouns with reflexive morphology (e.g. *him-self* in English, *lui-même* in French). If reflexive meaning is expressed with a body part noun, e.g. a noun meaning ‘body’ or ‘head’ (*They are scolding their body* to mean ‘They are scolding themselves’), this also counts as 1. Emphatic pronouns (e.g. *She cooked it (by) herself.*) do not trigger a 1, since they do not express a participant.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if the grammar discusses an independent reflexive marker in the language or if you find clear examples of independent reflexive markers.
2. Code 0 if the grammar discusses reflexive morphology, reciprocal morphology, or reciprocal markers, but does not mention an independent reflexive marker. Write ‘not mentioned’ in the comment column.
3. Code 0 if the grammar does not mention an independent reflexive marker in the language, but is otherwise comprehensive.
4. Code ? if the grammar does not mention any independent reflexive marker, but you think the author may have missed them or for some reason does not discuss them. This includes cases where there are potential examples of reflexive markersin texts/sentences but you are not sure whether or not to treat them as such.

## Examples

**Hõne** (ISO 639-3: juh, Glottolog: hone1235)

Hõne has reflexive pronouns that are formed from the word for ‘body’, *dɪ̀rɪ̀*, which occurs as the bound form *dɪ̀r-* in this context, and the possessive pronoun referring to the person performing the reflexive action: themselves becomes *dɪ̀r-bɛ̄ɛ̄* ‘body-3PL.POSS’ (Storch 1999: 135–136). Hõne is coded 1.

```
bə̄-gwààn    bə́    dɪ̀r-bɛ̄ɛ̄
3PL-kill    with  body-3PL.POSS
‘They killed themselves.’ (Storch 1999: 136)
```

**Kumzari** (ISO 639-3: zum, Glottolog: kumz1235)

Kumzari has one reflexive form that is used for all persons and numbers, i.e. *xō* (van der Wal Anonby 2015: 62). Kumzari is coded 1.

```
gardīd-iš          xō    tēr-ē
turn.into:REAL-3S  REFL  bird-a
‘She turned herself into a bird.’ (van der Wal Anonby 2015: 62)
```

**Rapanui** (ISO 639-3: rap, Glottolog: rapa1244)

Rapanui does not have a specialized reflexive form, and is coded 0. Semantically reflexive clauses are expressed with the regular independent pronoun for the person performing the action (Kieviet 2017: 432–433).

```
¿Ko    haŋa   'ā    koe   mo   hore   atu    i    a     koe?
PFV    want   CONT  2SG   for  cut    away   ACC  PREP  2SG
‘Do you want to cut yourself?’ (Kieviet 2017: 432)
```

GB306,Is there a phonologically independent non-bipartite reciprocal pronoun?,"## Is there a phonologically independent reciprocal marker that does not consist of two quantifiers (e.g. each + other; two + two)?

## Summary

Reciprocal markers indicate that an action or feeling is mutual across two or more parties (e.g. *they love each other*; *they beat each other*). This feature targets [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) reciprocal markers that do *not* consist of two quantifiers. Such markers may be described as pronouns, particles or auxiliaries. They may be composite, as long as they do not consist of two quantifiers. A reciprocal marker may indicate both reflexive and reciprocal functions. It needs to be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not limited to a small set of verbs that are probably lexicalized.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if there is at least one phonologically independent reciprocal marker in the language that is not synchronically recognizable as composed of two quantifiers.
2. Code 0 if there are no phonologically independent (non-bipartite) reciprocal markers in the language.
3. Code 0 if a grammar discusses reciprocal markers, reflexive markers, or bound reciprocal markers, but does not mention or contain an example of a reciprocal marker that does not consist of two quantifiers. Write ‘not mentioned’ as a comment.
4. Code 0 if reciprocal markers are not mentioned in an otherwise comprehensive grammar of the language.
5. Code ? if you do not have enough information to know whether a reciprocal marker can be analyzed as consisting of two quantifiers or not.

## Examples

**Kosraean** (ISO 639-3: kos, Glottolog: kosr1238)

Kosraean features a complex reciprocal marker, *sie sin sie*, literally translatable as ‘one of one’ (Lee 1975: 107). As such, it qualifies as a bipartite reciprocal marker and does not trigger a 1 for this feature. It is coded 0.

```
a. Eltahl   luhngse    sie    sin   sie.
   they     like       one    of    one
   ‘They like each other.’ (Lee 1975: 107)

b. Kuht    etuh    sie     sin    sie.
   we      know    one     of     one
   ‘We know each other.’ (Lee 1975: 107)
```

**Western Farsi** (ISO 639-3: pes, Glottolog: west2369)

Western Farsi features both a bipartite reciprocal marker, *ye ... digar* (or *yak ... digar*) and a non-bipartite one, *ham*, which also means ‘same’ in other parts of the grammar (Windfuhr & Perry 2009: 437). The latter triggers a 1 for this feature.

```
a. yek-i     pas     az    digar-i
   one-INDF  after   from  other-INDF
   ‘one after another’ (Windfuhr & Perry 2009: 437)

b. az       ham         jodā      šod-and|
   from     each.other  separated become.PST-3PL
   ‘They parted.’, lit. 'They became separate from each other.' (Windfuhr & Perry 2009: 437)
```

**Bargam** (ISO 639-3: mlp, Glottolog: barg1252)

Bargam has an independent non-bipartite marker, *an*, that fulfills both reciprocal and reflexive functions (Hepner 2006: 100). It is coded 1 for this feature.

```
a. on    in     an          tu-bulon       yaʔ-ay
   women they   each.other  PFV-speak.to   PST.IPFV-N1
   ‘The women were speaking to each other.’ (Hepner 2006: 100)

b. I    kab        an          huser-01-uʔ      ha(ʔ)-01-w.

   ‘Let’s divide up (ourselves) here.’ (Hepner 2006: 100)

GB309,"Are there multiple past or multiple future tenses, distinguishing distance from Time of Reference?","## Are there multiple past or multiple future tenses, distinguishing distance from time of reference?

## Summary
This question aims to capture productive marking of tense that makes distinctions into remoteness of time in relation to the point of reference or utterance. The actual marking can be tonal, verbal affixation, suppletion or any other means of marking. 

This feature pertains to temporal marking, not aspectual. ‘Present perfect’ and ‘pluperfect’ are not included since they do not denote difference in distance of time but sequence of events.

## Procedure
1. Look up the sections in the language description that deal with tense.
2. Check if there are markers of past or future tense at all.
3. If more than one function of future or past tense are described, and they are marked by separate forms, investigate whether the distinctions are aspectual or modal, or indeed relate to remoteness on the temporal axis.
4. If there is only a single past tense category and only a single future tense category, code the language as 0.
5. If it is unclear whether the distinction is aspectual/modal or temporal, code the language as ?.
6. If there are several function-form pairs described, but with little motivation and few examples to clearly explain what is going on, code the language as ?.
7. If it is clearly stated that the distinction has to do with remoteness of time, code the language as 1.

## Examples

**Sudest** (ISO 639-3: tgo, Glottolog: sude1239)

In Sudest, there are distinctions in remoteness in both past and future tenses. Anderson & Ross (2002: 335–339) outline this in a paradigm and also give the examples below. Sudest is coded as 1 for this feature.

```
a. Va        thï=utu
   DIST.PST  3PL=talk
   ‘They talked.’ (Anderson & Ross 2002: 339)

b. Methï=wa        e    la-ma         nggolo
   PROX.PST.3PL=go PREP POSS-1EXCL.PL house
   ‘They went (today or yesterday) to my house.’ (Anderson & Ross 2002: 336)

c. Na       ya-wa 
   PROX.FUT 1SG=go
   ‘They will go (today).’ (Anderson & Ross 2002: 337)

d. Ne   thï=kwaio
   FUT  3PL=work
   ‘They will work (after today).’ (Anderson & Ross 2002: 337)
```

Below is a helpful excerpt on the typological literature on this phenomenon from Hayashi (2011: 46):

""Cross-linguistically, it is not rare for a language to have multiple past (or future) tenses that cover different temporal domains (Dahl 1983, 1985, 2008; Comrie 1985; Mithun 1999; Dahl & Velupillai 2005: 269).

When a language has two past tenses covering different temporal domains, the cut-off point (boundary) is most commonly placed between ‘today’ and ‘before today’, in which case the tenses can be labeled with Latinate terms as hodiernal past and pre-hodiernal past (Dahl 1983, 1985, 2008; Comrie 1985; Dahl & Velupillai 2005). Another common cut-off point is that between ‘recently’ and ‘longer ago’. When a language has more than two past tenses, additional cut-off points may be placed between ‘yesterday’ and ‘before yesterday’, between ‘a few days ago’ and ‘more than a few days ago’, between ‘this year’ and ‘before this year’, etc.

Comrie (1985) also points out that tense systems across languages may contrast with one another not only with respect to how they segment the time-line, but also with respect to how rigid the boundaries between the segments are. Haya, for example, has three past tenses covering ‘today’ (the hodiernal past), ‘yesterday’ (the hesternal past), and ‘before yesterday’ (the pre-hesternal past). Their boundaries are rigid, in the sense that the hodiernal past can never be used to describe a situation in a time prior to the day of utterance. Sotho, in contrast, has the opposition of ‘recently’ vs. ‘not recently’, where the boundary is fluid in the sense that what counts as recent is left to the speaker’s subjective impression; it is possible, thus, to describe an event that took place several years or decades ago with a recent past form, as long as the speaker intends to emphasize the subjective recency.""

GB312,Is there overt morphological marking on the verb dedicated to mood?,"## Is there overt morphological marking on the verb dedicated to mood?

## Summary
This question is concerned with [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) marking on the verb that indicates grammatical mood. Grammatical mood is concerned with (1) the relationship between an event/state/action expressed in a clause and its actualization in reality (e.g. realis or irrealis) and/or (2) the speaker’s attitude towards the actualization of this event/state/action. This feature covers all grammatical moods, including declarative. The mood marker may be polysemous with other markers.

There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that a mood is expressed by a certain form on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing mood then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB312) and the features on free-standing mood marking ([GB119](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB119) and/or [GB519](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB519)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing a mood, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.

While negation or interrogation can be considered grammatical moods, they are not covered by this feature.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if mood is marked on the verb or on auxiliaries by an affix, suppletion, tonal marking or reduplication.
2. Code ? if mood is not described at all and the grammatical description is not comprehensive.
3. Code 0 if mood is not described at all and the grammatical description is comprehensive.

GB313,Are there special adnominal possessive pronouns that are not formed by an otherwise regular process?,"## Are there special adnominal possessive pronouns that are not formed by an otherwise regular process?

## Summary
This feature identifies phonologically independent possessive pronouns that are not formed by the application of regular possessive morphology or core case marking to more general pronominal forms. Instead, languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature form at least some possessive pronouns through some process other than the usual possessive marking, or, frequently, with suppletive forms. Note that special adnominal possessive pronouns are most commonly found in the first and second person.

To qualify as ‘special adnominal possessive pronouns’, the possessive pronouns must not be identical to the pronominal forms used for core arguments. It is not necessary for the possessive pronouns to be dedicated solely to the function of possession, provided that the criteria above are satisfied.

## Procedure
1. Identify the regular possessive construction(s) of the language, including all possessive constructions used with full nominal possessors (e.g. English *X’s Y*, and *Y of X’s*).
2. Identify the construction(s) used to express possession with a pronominal possessor.
3. If the pronominal possessors in the constructions identified in step 2 are regular formations that are identical to any constructions identified in step 1, code 0. 
4. If any of these possessive pronoun formation processes identified in 2 are different from those in 1 and result in forms that are *not* identical to the corresponding pronominal forms used to express core (S, A and P) arguments in this language, code 1.
4. If the pronominal possessors in any constructions identified in step 2 are expressed using phonologically independent, *suppletive* forms, code 1.
5. If no phonologically independent possessive pronouns exist, code 0 and include a comment to note the non-existence of the target forms.
6. If the phonologically independent pronouns used in adnominal possession are unmarked (bare), are identical to pronominal forms used for core (S, A and P) arguments, and are used in simple juxtaposition with the possessum nominal, code 0.
7. If the possessive pronouns that have triggered a 1 code are not entirely dedicated to the function of possession, please indicate in the comments any other functions these forms have.

## Examples
**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

Possession with a nominal possessor:

```
John’s book  
a friend of John’s
```
Possession with a pronominal possessor (first person):

```
my book (*I’s book)  
a friend of mine (*a friend of I’s)
```

English uses suppletive forms for these first person possessive pronouns, rather than using the morphological marking pattern that is used for possessive nouns. These pronouns (*my*/*mine*) are not identical to the non-possessive pronouns used to express core arguments. English is coded 1.

**Basque** (ISO 639-3: eus, Glottolog: basq1248)

The genitive *-en*/*-ren* is suffixed to nouns in Basque’s possessive noun phrases.

```
a. Muñagorri-ren bertsoak  
   Muñagorri-GEN verses  
   ‘Muñagorri’s verses’ (Hualde & de Urbana 2003: 143)

b. nere aita-ren   etxea  
   my   father-GEN house  
   ‘my father’s house’ (Hualde & de Urbana 2003: 143)
```

The first and second person possessive pronouns in Basque are not formed through the application of the *-en*/*-ren* suffix to pronominal forms. The suffix *-re* (which is not used to mark pronouns for the core absolutive, ergative, or dative cases) is used to create most possessive pronouns, while a small number are suppletive.

| **Person/Number** | **Personal** | **Possessive** |
|---|---|---|
| 1SG | _ni_ (‘I’) | _ene, nere, nire_ (‘my’) |
| 2SG (intimate) | _hi_ (‘you’) | _hire_ (‘your’) |
| 2SG (unmarked) | _zu_ (‘you’) | _zure_ (‘your’) |
| 1PL | _gu_ (‘we’) | _gure_ (‘our’) |
| 2PL | _zuek_ (‘you’) | _zuen_ (‘your’) |

(Hualde & de Urbana 2003, 144)

While the paradigm is not entirely uniform, the regular suffixation process that is used to form many of the possessive pronouns is different from the morphology associated with possessive nouns and from the morphology used to mark personal pronouns for core cases. This is sufficient to trigger a 1 value for this feature. There are also suppletive forms in the first person (e.g. *ene*, *zuen*). These suppletive possessive pronouns are also sufficient to trigger a 1 value for this feature. Basque is therefore coded 1.


**Luo** (ISO 639-3: luo, Glottolog: luok1236)

Luo has a series of possessive pronouns that are formed by a regular process in which the personal pronoun is suffixed to the form *mar* ‘belonging to (singular)’ or *mag*/*mek* ‘belonging to (plural)’. The resulting pronouns are as follows (Okoth Okombo 1997: 57–59):

| **Person/Number** | **Personal** | **Possessive** |
|---|---|---|
| 1SG | _-a_ (‘I’) | _mar-a_ (‘my’) |
| 2SG | _-i_ (‘you’) | _mar-i_ (‘your (SG)’) |
| 3SG | _-e_, _-go_ (‘he/she/it’) | _mar-e_ (‘his/her/its’) |
| 1PL | _-wa_ (‘we’) | _mar-wa_ (‘our’) |
| 2PL | _-u_ (‘you all’) | _mar-u_ (‘your (PL)’) |
| 3PL |  _-gi_ (‘they’)  | _mar-gi_ (‘their’) |

In practice, adnominal possession involving a pronominal possessor is typically expressed by marking the possessum noun with the personal pronominal suffix that corresponds to the person/number of the possessor, as in the example below (Okoth Okombo 1997: 59):

GB314,Can augmentative meaning be expressed productively by a shift of gender/noun class?,"## Can augmentative meaning be expressed productively by a shift of noun class/gender?

## Summary
Can augmentative function be marked by a shift of [noun class?](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) This needs to be a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) pattern. Augmentative marking generally intensifies the noun (in size as well as various other properties). Here the augmentative construction must minimally be used to encode augmented size.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if there are morphemes in the sentence which vary depend depending on the noun used, and these morphemes are a closed class of under about 30 (our definition of a gender system),
2. And one of these morphemes can be used to change the meaning of a noun by adding the meaning ‘big’.
3. Code 0 if the author is explicit that the language does not have gender/noun classes.
4. Code 0 if the augmentative can be expressed by a shift of gender/noun class but the pattern is not productive.
5. Code 0 if there are no augmentative markers in the language.
6. Code ? if it is not clear from the data whether augmentatives can be expressed with a shift in gender/noun class.
 
## Examples

**Lunda** (ISO 639-3: lun, Glottolog: lund1266)

Coded 1. ""Classes 6, 7, and 11 noun prefixes *ma-*. *chi-* and *lu-* respectively may also be used derivationally with nouns from other classes to denote augmentative or derogation and command concords instead of the inherent noun class prefix... The prefix *lu-* replaces the original class prefix of noun to express enormity or large quantity."" (Kawasha 2003: 92–93)

**Hixkaryana** (ISO 639-3: hix, Glottolog: hixk1239) 

Coded 0. There is a phonologically bound augmentative marker on the noun marking larger size. This marker is unrelated to any noun class system (Derbyshire 1979: 83–84).

GB315,Can diminutive meaning be expressed productively by a shift of gender/noun class?,"## Can diminutive meaning be expressed productively by a shift of noun class/gender?

## Summary
Can diminutive function (i.e. smaller size) be marked by a shift of [noun class?](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) We are looking for morphemes in the sentence which vary depending on the noun used, and whether one of these morphemes can be used to change the meaning of a noun by adding the meaning ‘small’. This needs to be a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) pattern. Diminutive function often also entails other meanings, but it needs to minimally encode smaller size.

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if the diminutive can be expressed productively by a shift of gender/noun class.
2. Code 0 if none of the language’s diminutive marking strategies involve a shift in gender or noun class.
3. Code 0 if the author is explicit that the language does not have gender/noun classes.
4. Code 0 if the diminutive can be expressed by a shift of gender/noun class but the pattern is not productive.
5. Code 0 if there are no diminutive markers in the language.
6. Code ? if it is not clear from the data whether diminutives involve a shift in noun class/gender.
7. Code ? if it is not clear how productive a noun class/gender expressed diminutive is, and if the discussion and data is limited.

## Examples

**Shona** (ISO 639-3: sna, Glottolog: shon1251)

Coded 1. In the Bantu language Shona ""The prefixes of classes 13 and 12 are used only in secondary function. Nouns with these prefixes all signify small things. Usually, these are regarded in a favourable light as pleasing to the eye, but sometimes the effect of these diminutives may be derogatory when the prefixes are used with a stem which otherwise indicates something large or important.""

**Pite Saami** (ISO 639-3: sje, Glottolog:  pite1240)

Coded 0. In Pite Saami, there is a diminutive suffix which attaches to the noun stem indicating smaller size. This diminutive is not expressed by a shift in gender/noun class.

GB316,Is singular number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a dedicated phonologically free element?,"## Is singular number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?

## Summary
This question concerns regular marking of singular number in the noun phrase by a marker that is not bound to the noun, but free-standing. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB042 Is there a productive overt morphological singular marker on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB042), which focuses on the bound marking of singular number. (For more on wordhood and bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27).)

Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular. 

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with number or with noun phrases.
2. If the author describes an overt free-standing marker of singular number that occurs regularly, code 1.
3. If the grammar describes singular number as not marked productively or as only expressed with a bound marker, code 0.
5. If the grammar does not describe number marking at all and you have a reason to believe that the author may have missed it, code ?.
6. If the grammar does not describe number, you encounter no examples of number marking, and the grammar is otherwise comprehensive, code 0.

## Examples
**Samoan** (ISO 639-3: smo, Glottolog: samo1305)

Number in Samoan is regularly expressed by a free-standing element that fuses specificity and number. It is labeled ""article"". Samoan is an example of 1-coding for GB316. The articles of Samoan can be illustrated with the word _fale_ ‘house’:

(Mosel & Hovdhaugen 1992: 90)

| | singular | plural | 
|-------- | ---- | ----------- | 
|specific| _le fale_ | _fale_ | 
|non-specific| _se fale_ | _ni fale_ |

## Summary
This feature intends to capture dual marking with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. Nouns derived from adjectives or verbs are not relevant. This feature contrasts with [GB043	Is there a productive morphological dual marker on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB043) which focuses on bound marking of dual number.

Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.

It can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with number or with noun phrases.
2. If the author describes an overt free-standing marker of dual number that occurs regularly, code 1.
3. If the grammar describes dual number as not marked productively or as only expressed with a bound marker, code 0.

In Lenkael nouns are marked for dual number by the free-standing marker _mil_ Lynch(1978: 34). Lenakel is coded 1.

‘because of the young woman, mother of dogs’ (Lim 1997: 209)
```

**French** (ISO 639-3: fra, Glottolog: stan1290)

French definite and indefinite articles are free-standing markers (sometimes, they are bound). The articles have different forms in the plural (*les* ‘DEF.PL’, *des* ‘INDF.PL’) and the singular (*le* ‘M.DEF.SG’, *la* ‘F.DEF.SG’, *un* ‘M.INDF.SG’, *une* ‘F.INDF.SG’. French is coded 1.

## Examples

**Futuna-Aniwa** (ISO 639-3: fut, Glottolog: futu1245)

Trial marking is not common and since a similar enough meaning can often be expressed with a plural marker, trial is rarely (if ever) described as being obligatory. Futuna-Aniwa makes regular use of articles, and there are separate specific articles for trial (and dual) number. This marker is different from the numeral three (_tolu_) and triggers 1

> The trial article is taka. taka can occur with any substantive in a nominal phrase. Indication of the trial
number in the specific article is rare in natural conversation. Either the singular or plural articles may 
be substituted for taka. (Dougherty 1983: 23)

```
a. taka      fare 
   SPEC.TRL  house
   ‘the three houses’ (Dougherty 1983: 23)

GB320,Is paucal number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a dedicated phonologically free element?,"## Is paucal number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?

## Summary
This question concerns regular marking of paucal number in the noun phrase by a marker that is not bound to the noun but [free-standing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). This marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB166 Is there a productive morphological paucal marker on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB166)) which focuses on bound marking of paucal number. For more on wordhood and bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). 

Number marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.

It can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.

## Procedure

1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with number or noun phrases.
2. If the author describes an overt free-standing marker of paucal number that occurs regularly, code 1.
3. If the grammar describes paucal number as not marked productively or as only expressed with a bound marker, code as 0.
4. If the grammar does not describe number marking at all and you have a reason to believe that the author may have missed it, code ?.
5. If the grammar does not describe number, you encounter no examples of number marking, and the grammar is otherwise comprehensive, code 0.

## Examples
**Iaai** (ISO 639-3: iai, Glottolog: iaai1238)

In Iaai, number is marked on articles and there is a paucal distinction. Iaai is coded as 1 for GB320.

Lynch (2000: 870)

""Articles mark the following contrasts_ [..] specific number: singular (zero), dual (*li*), paucal/plural (*jee*)""

| | SG | DU | PAU | PL | 
|-------- | ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| definite |  | _li_ |_jee_|_ta_, _ta jee_| 
| indefinite | _ke_ | _ke li_| _ke jee_ | _ke ta jee_ |

GB321,Is there a large class of nouns whose gender/noun class is not phonologically or semantically predictable?,"## Is there a large class of nouns whose noun class/gender is not phonologically or semantically predictable?

## Summary
A noun class/gender system categorizes nouns for the purposes of grammatical [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) with other constituents in the noun phrase or other inflectional morphology. See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature asks whether the noun class/gender system of a language includes a large or open class of nouns whose assignment to that class is not predictable based on phonology or semantics. In other words, such a class will appear to be assigned arbitrarily.

Keep in mind that it is common for noun classes to include members that are not entirely predictable. Noun classes that are generally organized around a semantic or phonological property may also include some idiosyncratic members. The arbitrary assignment of some nouns to otherwise semantically or phonologically defined classes is **not** what this feature targets.

## Procedure
1. If there is [a system of nominal classification](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) where some markers vary based on the category of the noun,
2. And if these markers are **not** used only with numerals, demonstratives, and possessors (or some subset of these categories),
3. And if these markers are involved in [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) within the noun phrase, inflectional marking of the noun, or [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns),
4. And if there is a large or open set of nouns that forms a single gender/noun class and whose members do not obviously share any semantic or phonological properties, code 1.
3. If there are no genders/noun classes whose members do not generally share certain semantic or phonological properties, code 0.
4. If the only genders/noun classes whose members do not generally share semantic or phonological properties are small and not open, code 0.
5. If there is one or more gender category/noun class that is generally semantically or phonologically predictable (e.g. based on the semantic criteria described in [GB051](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB051), [GB052](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB052), [GB053](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB053), or [GB054](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB054)) but with exceptions to that predictability, and no other large or open gender/noun class category whose members are not clearly related by semantic or phonological properties, code 0.

## Examples
**Mullukmulluk** (ISO 639-3: mpb, Glottolog: mull1237)

This language categorizes nouns into four noun classes, three of which are defined by semantic characteristics: plants and vegetable food, trees, and animals hunted for food. The fourth is a large ""residual morphologically unmarked class"" that contains all nouns not included in any of these three semantically-defined classes (Birk 1976: 97–98). Mullukmulluk is coded 1.


**Zuni** (ISO 639-3: zun, Glottolog: zuni1245)

Zuni has three noun classes. Class 1 ""is a large and productive class, containing not only the greatest proportion of basic roots but also roots formed by a number of derivations"" (Newman 1965: 55). Class 2 contains only basic monosyllabic roots, and class 3 consists of roots formed by *-la* (objects in a shallow container) or *-pa* (objects in a deep container). While phonological, morphological, and semantic properties are involved in the categorization of nouns into classes 2 and 3, class 1 is a large, open noun class. Zuni is coded 1.

**Iatmul** (ISO 639-3: ian, Glottolog: iatm1242)

In Iatmul, animate nouns associated with biological sex (e.g. ‘man’, ‘woman’) are assigned to a fixed gender category based on sex. Most nouns that are not associated with biological sex can be used with either masculine or feminine gender, typically resulting in semantic differences related to the size of the referent (i.e. masculine gender imparts a reading of larger size; feminine imparts a reading of smaller size). A small number of nouns are assigned arbitrarily to a fixed gender category. These include the meanings ‘sun’ (masc.), ‘moon’ (fem.), ‘wind’ (masc. in Nyaula dialect, fem. in Pali’bei dialect), certain animal species names and certain generic animal names (Jendraschek 2012: 124–127). Although the assignment of nouns to fixed gender categories is not perfectly predictable based on biological sex, the number of nouns that are assigned arbitrarily to a fixed class is small and though the patterns are not exceptionless, the gender categories in this language are substantially semantically defined. Iatmul is coded 0.

GB322,Is there grammatical marking of direct evidence (perceived with the senses)?,"## Is there grammatical marking of direct evidence (perceived with the senses)?

## Summary
This question is concerned with the marking of evidentiality related to the speaker’s direct sensory evidence for some event or action. Grammatical marking of evidentials involves the use of grammaticalized markers such as affixes or other morphology, evidential particles, or evidential auxiliary verbs to convey the evidential meaning. Grammatical marking contrasts with constructions that express this meaning by means of adverbs (e.g. *John **apparently** ate the cake*) or lexical verbs in multi-clausal constructions (e.g. *I **saw** that John had eaten the cake*). Visual evidence is a common form of information encoded with a direct evidential, however direct evidentiality may also include auditory or other non-visual categories of sensory evidence. This question should be coded 1 if the language has a single direct evidential or any number of sensory evidentials.

## Procedure
1. If the language has one or more grammatical marker(s) (affixes, other morphological markers, particles, auxiliaries) dedicated to expressing that the speaker has direct sensory evidence (e.g. visual) of an event or action, code 1.
2. If the language does not use a grammatical marker to indicate that the speaker has direct sensory evidence of an event or action, code 0.
3. If the language expresses direct evidence of an event or action only through the use of adverbs or lexical verbs, code 0.

## Examples
**Eastern Pomo** (ISO 639-3: peb, Glottolog: east2545)

""*-ink’e* The non-visual evidential indicates that the basis for the statement made is evidence arrived at through the speaker’s personal perception using a sense other than sight"" (McLendon 1975: 98).


```

   (McLendon 1975: 99; glosses based on McLendon 2003)

b. ki·yá·t’a Ɂéč-ink’e?
   who       sneeze-SENS
   ‘Who sneezed?’ (the speaker heard the sneeze but does not know who did the sneezing)
   (McLendon 1975: 99; glosses based on McLendon 2003)
```

Eastern Pomo is coded as 1 for this feature.

## Summary
This question is concerned with the marking of evidentiality related to the speaker's indirect, non-sensory evidence for some event or action. Grammatical marking of evidentials involves the use of grammaticalized markers such as affixes or other morphology, evidential particles, or evidential auxiliary verbs to convey the evidential meaning, in contrast to constructions that create this meaning through the use of adverbs (e.g. *John **reportedly** ate the cake*) or lexical verbs in multi-clause constructions (e.g. *They **say** that John ate the cake*). Indirect evidentiality usually involves inference from physical evidence or second-hand knowledge such as hearsay. This question should be coded 1 if there is a single category of indirect evidentiality or any number of inferential or reportative evidential categories that are marked grammatically.

## Procedure
1. If the language has one or more grammatical marker(s) (affixes, other morphology, particles auxiliaries) dedicated to expressing that the speaker has indirect evidence (e.g. hearsay, inference) of an event or action, code 1.
2. If the language does not use a grammatical marker to indicate that the speaker has indirect evidence of an event or action, code 0.
3. If the language expresses indirect evidence of an event or action only through the use of adverbs or lexical verbs in periphrastic constructions, code 0.

## Examples

**Eastern Pomo** (ISO 639-3: peb, Glottolog: east2545)

""*·le*, the hearsay evidential suffix, indicates that the speaker’s information comes not from direct observation or experience, but rather from someone else’s recounting of the events described. The hearsay evidential is generally not translated, but occasionally, for greater clarity, I have translated it with the phrase ‘they say’. The hearsay evidential suffix always co-occurs with the hearsay evidential particle *xa* which may be preposed to the verb suffixed with *-·le* or which may occur as a separate word at the beginning of a clause of which the verb suffixed with *-·le* is the head"" (McLendon 1975: 99; formatting adapted).

GB324,"Is there an interrogative verb for content interrogatives (who?, what?, etc.)?","## Is there an interrogative verb for content interrogatives (who?, what?, etc.)?

## Summary
Interrogative verbs are verbs that include a semantic wh-element. In other words, the semantic content of interrogative verb roots includes an element equivalent to a content question, with meanings such as, ‘to do what’ or ‘to be who’. The wh-element must behave like a verb in the language. In English, for example, it would require regular verbal morphology, as in, *You what-ed yesterday?* (meaning, ‘what did you do yesterday?’). The feature does not include verbs of asking (e.g. English *ask*, *inquire*) or interrogative forms created through affixation of interrogative markers to non-interrogative verb roots.

## Procedure

1. Find all sections of the grammar that describe content (wh-) questions and interrogative clauses.
2. If the source describes verb roots with clear interrogative (wh-) meanings, code 1
3. If the source describes content interrogative constructions in some detail, but interrogative verbs are not mentioned, code 0
4. If the source does not describe content interrogative constructions in much detail, code ? and provide a comment regarding the insufficient evidence.

## Examples

**Tiri-Mea** (ISO 639-3: cir, Glottolog: tiri1258)

Tiri-Mea has the following verb roots for content interrogatives (Osumi 1995: 229):

* *trò* ‘what is the matter with’ is a verb asking about the subject’s problematic situation; 
* *hwasââwe* ‘how to know, on what evidence’ is either a verb or a posthead modifier, asking about the evidentiality of information supplied by the addressee.

The first of these interrogatives is given in the following example :
```
nrâ   trò      â    rroto
3SG   matter   SBJ  car
‘What is the matter with the car?’ (Osumi 1995: 229)
```
This language also uses several non-verbal content interrogatives: *ne* ‘what’, *anròi* ‘how many’, *jaa* ‘who’, *anr* ‘what time’, *(â)e* ‘where’, *unròi* ‘how many times’.

Even though there are only two verbal content interrogatives and the more common and more general interrogatives are not verbs, the existence of any interrogative verbs for content interrogatives triggers a 1.

**Arapaho** (ISO 639-3: arp, Glottolog: arap1274)

Arapaho is a polysynthetic language with highly complex verb forms. The content question (wh-) forms in the language typically occur as prefixes or proclitics in verbal forms (Cowell & Moss 2008: 241). This is shown in the following examples:
```
a. heitousíneyéi3éí?
   e-ii-tousi-neyei3ei
   2SG-IPFV-what-go.to.school
   ‘What are you learning/doing at school?’ (Cowell & Moss 2008: 242)

b. heitou3ééneyéi3éí?
   e-ii-tou3ee-neyei3ei
   2SG-IPFV-why-go.to.school
   ‘Why are you going to school?’ (Cowell & Moss 2008: 243)

c. héétou’úneyéi3éí?
   e-eti-tou’u-neyei3ei
   2SG-FUT-when-go.to.school
   ‘When will you go to school?’ (Cowell & Moss 2008: 243)

d. tootéíneyéi3éí?
   toot=e-ii-neyei3ei
   where=2SG-IPFV-go.to.school
   ‘Where do you go to school?’ (Cowell & Moss 2008: 243)
```
The occurrence of wh-morphemes in Arapaho preverbs, as shown above, is not sufficient to trigger a 1, as these examples involve non-interrogative verb roots. The wh-forms in Arapaho can also be used as verb initials with lexical verb finals to create complex verb stems, as shown below:

```
e. heihtou3éetoo?
   e-ih-tou3ee-too
   2SG-PST-why-do(ANIM.TR)
   ‘Why did you do that?’ (Cowell & Moss 2008: 245)
```
Again, the occurrence of wh-forms in the verbal domain in the example above is not sufficient to trigger a 1, as these forms require non-interrogative verb roots. Content interrogative forms in Arapaho can also combine with abstract verb finals to create existential constructions with wh- meanings.

```
e. tohuu-tox
   ‘how many’ (Cowell & Moss 2008: 244)

f. tohúutóxuno
   ‘How many are there?’ (Cowell & Moss 2008: 244)
```
Again, the creation of existential clauses through the combination of interrogative morphemes with non-interrogative forms is not sufficient to trigger a 1, as it involves a non-interrogative verb final and it is unclear to what extent the wh-forms in these existential clauses behave specifically like verbs. The morphosyntactic properties of languages like Arapaho can make this feature difficult to code, but Arapaho is coded 0.

GB325,Is there a count/mass distinction in interrogative quantifiers?,"## Is there a count/mass distinction in interrogative quantifiers?

## Summary
When interrogatives are used to question quantity, are different interrogative forms used to quantify count nouns and mass nouns? For example, English contrasts *how many* for count nouns (as in, *how many apples?*) and *how much* for mass nouns (as in, *how much sand?*). Languages that have at least one form that means either ‘how much' (of a mass noun) or ‘how many' (of a count noun), but not the alternative, are considered to have a count/mass distinction in interrogative quantifiers. Languages in which any interrogative quantifiers can be used interchangeably with both count and mass nouns do not have the relevant distinction.

## Procedure

1. Identify the interrogative forms that can be used to quantify nominals (as in English *how much* or *how many*).
2. If the form used to express the meaning ‘how much' (of a mass noun) is different from the form used to express ‘how many' (of a count noun), code 1.
2. If the form(s) used to express the meaning ‘how much' (of a mass noun) can also be used to express the meaning ‘how many' (of a count noun), and vice-versa, code 0.
4. If there are multiple forms used to express the meanings ‘how much’ and/or ‘how many’, and at least one form is restricted to meaning either ‘how much’ (of a mass noun) or ‘how many’ (of a count noun) to the exclusion of the alternative, code 1.
5. If a single interrogative quantifier is discussed, which is glossed as ‘how much/many’, but examples with both count and mass nouns are not provided, code 0.
6. If one or both of the meanings ‘how much’ (of a mass noun) and ‘how many’ (of a count noun) is not mentioned or included in glossing and there are insufficient examples to identify interrogative quantifiers for both count and mass nouns, code ? and provide a comment.

## Examples

**Woods Cree** (ISO 639-3: cwd, Glottolog: wood1236)

Woods Cree has separate content question words for the meanings ‘how much’ and ‘how many’ that are used with mass and count nouns respectively.
```

Q+so.far/long
‘how much’ (Starks 1992: 165)

tântahto
tân+tahto

```
Woods Cree is coded 1.

**Maricopa** (ISO 639-3: mrc, Glottolog: mari1440)

A construction involving the verb *lyvii-k* and the interrogative prefix *ka-* is used in Maricopa to express both the meaning ‘how many’ (of a count noun) and ‘how much’ (of a mass noun).
```
m-naw-sh      ka-lyvii-m    m-wii-m
2-friend-SBJ  Q-be.like-DS  2-do-Q.REAL
‘How many friends do you have?’ (Gordon 1986: 205)

shiyaal  ka-lyvii-m    m-wii-m
money    Q-be.like-DS  2-do-Q.REAL  
‘How much money do you have?’ (Gordon 1986: 205)
```
Maricopa is coded 0.

GB326,Do (nominal) content interrogatives normally or frequently occur in situ?,"## Do (nominal) content interrogatives normally or frequently occur in situ?

## Summary
Is there a commonly used content question construction in which the interrogative pronoun or NP (e.g. English *who* or *which one*) occurs in the normal position for a non-interrogative NP in the same participant role (i.e. ‘in situ’)? Many languages usually place the wh-constituent in situ (e.g. *The man took **what**?*; cf. *The man took **an umbrella**.*), while others require wh-constituents to occur in a specific position (e.g. clause-initially) regardless of the usual position of the corresponding non-interrogative NP (e.g. English ***What** did the man take?*). Here we are interested in identifying languages that frequently or generally use an interrogative construction with nominal wh-constituents in situ. This question should be coded 1 if questions formed with in situ interrogatives are pragmatically unmarked and are used commonly (e.g. not only in restrictive contexts such as echo questions or constructions with multiple interrogatives).

## Procedure

1. Identify the constructions used for content questions, and determine which are commonly used and pragmatically unmarked (e.g. exclude echo questions, constructions with multiple interrogative constituents).
2. Identify the constituent order(s) that occur in non-interrogative clauses (i.e. declarative transitive and intransitive clauses).
3. If, in any common construction identified in step 1, nominal wh-constituents (e.g. ‘who’, ‘which one’) occur in the same position(s) identified in step 2 for non-interrogative NPs with the same participant role (i.e. in situ), code 1.
4. If, in all common constructions identified in step 1, nominal wh-constituents occur in a fixed position (e.g. clause-initial) that does not always correspond to the position of a non-interrogative NP with the same participant role, code 0.
5. If word order is described as free or flexible and examples suggest that nominal wh-constituents can occur in the same positions as non-interrogative NPs with the same participant roles, code 1.
6. If word order is described as free or flexible but it is unclear from descriptions and examples whether nominal wh-constituents occur in a special position rather than in situ, code ? and provide a comment.
7. If there are no nominal wh-constituents (e.g. where wh-verbs are used instead), code 0 and provide a comment.
8. If there is insufficient evidence to identify the common, pragmatically unmarked content question construction(s), code ? and provide a comment.

## Examples

**Second Mesa** (ISO 639-3: hop, Glottolog: seco1242)

In the Hopi language of Second Mesa, question words can occur either in situ or in a fronted position, as shown below (Jeanne 1978: 178-179):
```
ya  ʔɨm  haki-y   wɨvaʔta
Q   you  who-OBL  hit
‘Whom did you hit?’ (wh-in situ)

ya  haki-y   ʔɨm  wɨvaʔta
Q   who-OBL  you  hit
‘Whom did you hit?’ (wh-fronted)
```
Fronting is entirely optional, and neither of these constructions is pragmatically marked or restricted in use. Because the wh-in situ content question construction is commonly used and pragmatically unmarked, it triggers a 1 value for this feature for Second Mesa.

**Canichana** (ISO 639-3: caz, Glottolog: cani1243)

According to Crevels (2012: 443), interrogative pronouns in Canichana always occur in clause-initial position, as in the example below:
```
nacu  een-ariva
what  2SG-want
‘What do you want?’ 
(Cardús 1886: 317, as cited in Crevels 2012)
```
Canichana is coded 0, as Canichana uses (S)VO word order in the corresponding non-interrogative constructions and the uniformly clause-initial wh-pronouns in the common interrogative construction thus cannot be considered to be in situ (Crevels 2012: 443).

**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

The standard content interrogative construction in English obligatorily places the wh-constituent in a clause initial position (e.g. ***What** did the man take?*). However, it is also possible to leave the wh-constituent in the same position that a non-interrogative NP with the same participant role would occur, accompanied by a special intonational pattern (e.g. *The man took **what**?*). However, the wh-in situ question construction in English is used for echo questions or when multiple wh-constituents occur (e.g. ***Who** took **what**?*), and is not the general, frequently used interrogative construction in the language. Therefore, English is coded 0.

GB327,Can the relative clause follow the noun?,"## Can the relative clause follow the noun?

## Summary

Can non-correlative relative clauses immediately follow the noun they modify? In other words, are there relative clauses with the structure *[The woman **[who has a green hat]** is tall*? This question only concerns relative clauses that immediately follow the noun, without requiring an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause – which would make them correlative relative clauses (e.g. *[The woman who has a green hat] she is tall*) (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)).

## Procedure

1. Consider only non-correlative clauses: disregard relative clauses that have an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause.
2. Code 1 if a source mentions that relative clauses are or can be postnominal.
3. Code 1 if you find examples of postnominal relative clauses.
4. Code 0 if a source mentions that relative clauses cannot be postnominal.
5. Code 0 if a source describes prenominal or internally headed relative clauses but does not discuss postnominal relative clauses.
6. Code ? if there are examples that contain potential postnominal relative clauses but the analysis is inconclusive.
7. Code ? if the source does not treat relative clauses in much detail and may have missed postnominal relative clauses.

## Examples

**Neverver** (ISO 639-3: lgk, Glottolog: ling1265)

In Neverver, relative clauses are always postnominal, just like other nominal modifiers (Barbour 2012: 147). Neverver is coded 1.

```
Niterikh  an  im-ngar      nakh   i-tokh         si.
child     REL 3SG.IRR-cry  here   3SG.REAL-exist NEG
‘There is no child who is crying here.’
(Barbour 2012: 149)
```

**Awtuw** (ISO 639-3: kmn, Glottolog: awtu1239)

In Awtuw, relative clauses precede the noun (Feldman 1986: 164). The only examples of postnominal relative clauses are non-restrictive relative clauses with an intonation break and may be interpreted as combinations of two separate appositional noun phrases, rather than a single noun phrase with a noun and a relative clause (Feldman 1986: 132). This language is thus an example without postnominal relative clauses. Awtuw is coded 0.

Prenominal relative clause:

```
a. rey    yen    tawkway  da-kl-a-re       rame(-re-k) lakna-kay
   3SG.M  2SG    tobacco  FACT-get-PST-O   man-O-INTS  die-PRF
   ‘the man you got tobacco from has died’ (Feldman 1986: 164)
```

Appositional noun phrases, including a relative clause:

```
b. rey    nawer   wiye-taw     du-k-uwk-iy-re
   3SG.M  father  garden-tree  FACT-IPFV-fell-IPFV-O
   ‘the father, who was felling a garden tree’ (Feldman 1986: 132)
```
**Umbu-Ungu** (ISO 639-3: ubu, Glottolog: umbu1258)

In Umbu-Ungu, relative clauses may either precede or follow the noun (Head 2011: 81). REL-NOUN is the dominant pattern (Head 2011: 2). Umbu-Ungu is coded 1.

Relative clause following the noun:

```
kapisi   koyo-ngi             aku-mu-nge     mare
cabbage  steam.cook-NPST.3PL  REL-the.SG-LOC some
‘some of the cabbage which they had steam cooked’ (Head 2011: 81)
```

Relative clause preceding the noun:

```

**Umbu-Ungu** (ISO 639-3: ubu, Glottolog: umbu1258)

In Umbu-Ungu, relative clauses may either precede or follow the noun (Head 2011: 81). REL-NOUN is the dominant pattern (Head 2011: 2), but the fact that some relative clauses precede the noun is enough to trigger 1 for this feature.

Relative clause preceding the noun:

GB329,Are there internally-headed relative clauses?,"## Are there internally-headed relative clauses that are not correlative relative clauses?

## Summary

Can a relativized noun be morphosyntactically part of the relative clause? This could mean different things in different languages. In some languages, the relativized noun may literally be inside the relative clause, in terms of placement, for example *[A green hat **[the woman]** has] is tall* to mean ‘The woman who has a green hat is tall’. In other languages, the noun may receive case marking for its function inside the relative clause rather than its function inside the main clause, for example *the man-SBJ greeted [**[the woman-SBJ]** who has a green hat]* as opposed to *the man-SBJ greeted [**[the woman-OBJ]** who has a green hat]*. Do not consider correlative relative clauses here (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)). It must be possible for the head noun to be any noun, not only an unspecific (pro)noun (e.g. *whoever*).

## Procedure

1. Consider only non-correlative clauses: disregard relative clauses that have an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause.
2. Code 1 if a source mentions that relative clauses are or can be internally headed.
3. Code 1 if you find examples of relative clauses where the noun is located inside the relative clause.
4. Code 1 if you find examples of head nouns case-marked for the function they have in the relative clause rather than the main clause.
5. Code 1 if you find other arguments for considering a relative clause internally headed.
6. Code 0 if a source mentions that relative clauses cannot be internally headed.
7. Code 0 if a source comprehensively describes relative clauses but does not discuss internally headed relative clauses.
8. Code ? if there are examples that contain potential internally headed relative clauses but the analysis is inconclusive.
9. Code ? if the source does not treat relative clauses in much detail and may have missed internally headed relative clauses.

## Examples

**Seediq** (ISO 629-3: trv, Glottolog: taro1264) and **Tagalog** (ISO 629-3: tgl, Glottolog: taga1270)

Seediq and Tagalog feature structurally similar internally headed relative clauses, where the head noun that is relativized is positioned within the relative clause, between an agent and a patient (Aldridge 2004: 100). Seesiq and Tagalog would be coded 1 in our dataset.

Seediq example:

```
s-n-malu     sapah  na	 tama
?-PFV-build  house  ERG  father
‘the house Father built’ (Aldridge 2004: 100)
```

Tagalog example:

```
b-in-ili-ng    libro  ni   Maria
?-PFV-buy-LK   book   ERG  Maria
‘the book Maria bought’ (Aldridge 2004: 100)
```

**Hidatsa** (ISO 629-3: hid, Glottolog: hida1246)

Hidatsa has a similar construction:

```
a. Mary  uuwáki  aku-híri-š          wa-rúci-c
   Mary  quilt   REL.S-make-DET.DEF  1SG.A-buy-DECL
   ‘I bought the quilt that Mary made.’ (Boyle 2016: 259)
```

Hidatsa also has **intransitive** internally headed relative clauses. These may be considered head-internal because relativized nouns do not carry their own determiner (-š): the determiner that usually comes on individual nouns may be carried by the relative clause, effectively encapsulating the head noun inside the relative clause (Boyle 2016: 256-257).

Simple main clause with individual nouns marked with the determiner *-š*:

```
b. wía-š         wacée-š     íkaa-c
   woman-DET.DEF man-DET.DEF see-DECL
   ‘The woman saw the man.’ (Boyle 2016: 256)
```
Internally headed relative clause taking the determiner *-š*:

``` 
c. wacée  aku-waapáahi-š     wía    íkaa-c
   man    REL.S-sing-DET.DEF woman  see-DECL
   ‘The man that sang saw the woman.’ (Boyle 2016: 257)
```

Hidatsa is coded 1 in Grambank.

**Korean** (ISO 629-3: kor, Glottolog: kore1280)

In Korean, there is an internally headed relative clause construction where the relativized noun takes case marking according to its function within the relative clause (here: _-ka_, NOM), not according to its function within the main clause. The case marker indicating the function of the noun in the main clause comes at the end of the full relative clause (here: _-ul_, ACC):

```
Tom-un  sakwa-ka   cayngpan-wi-ey  iss-nun    kes-ul    mekessta.
Tom-TOP apple-NOM  tray-TOP-LOC    exist-PLN  REL-ACC   ate
‘Tom ate an apple, which was on the tray.’ (Chung & Kim 2002: 43)

(Abbreviations: PLN plain speech level)
```
Korean is coded 1 in Grambank.

## Further reading

Much research on internally headed relative clauses focuses on specific theoretical frameworks (e.g. Aldridge 2004; Boyle 2016; Chung & Kim 2003). They contain valuable insights within those frameworks and extra examples which are helpful for the purpose of Grambank. Dryer (2013) includes internally headed relative clauses in a survey of word order, but discusses these less extensively. Lehmann (1986) is a classic overview of relative clauses.

GB330,Are there correlative relative clauses?,"## Are there correlative relative clauses?

## Summary

Are there relative clauses that require an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause? For example, *[The woman who has a green hat] **she** is tall.*

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions that there are correlative relative clauses or that there are relative clauses with an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause.
2. Code 1 if you find examples of relative clauses with an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause.
3. Code 0 if a source mentions that there are no correlative relative clauses or that relative clauses never have an anaphoric pronoun in the main clause.
4. Code 0 if a source comprehensively describes relative clauses but does not discuss correlative relative clauses (or anaphoric pronouns in main clauses in the context of relative clauses).
5. Code ? if there are examples that contain potential correlative relative clauses but the analysis is inconclusive.
6. Code ? if the source does not treat relative clauses in much detail and may have missed correlative relative clauses.

## Examples

**Hindi** (ISO 639-3: hin, Glottolog: hind1269)

Hindi has a correlative relative clause construction, where an anaphoric demonstrative is used in the main clause to link the relative clause and the main clause together (cf. Srivastav 1991). Hindi would be coded 1 for this feature.

```
jo  laRkii  khaRii    hai  vo  lambii  hai
REL girl    standing  is   DEM tall    is
‘The girl who is standing (she) is tall.’
```

**Egyptian Arabic** (ISO 639-3: arz, Glottolog: egyp1253)

In Egyptian Arabic, there is no anaphoric pronoun in the main clause coreferencing the relativized noun. This language is coded 0.

```
šuft   ilwilaad  illi  gaabu     lgawabaat
I.saw  the.boys  REL   bring:3PL letters
‘I saw the boys who brought the letters.’ (Abdel-Massih 1979: 234–235)
```

**Kam** (ISO 639-3: kdx, Glottolog: kamm1249) and **Bambara** (ISO 639-3: bam, Glottolog: bamb1269)

Some other clear examples of languages with correlative relative clauses are Kam and Bambara.

A correlative relative clause in Kam:

```
àwàn  ā    míŋ        ə́ŋꜜgwɔ́g   â,   ú     də́   rə́     ɲì     rīg.
king  REL  build:PFV  house     REL  3SG   be   with   thing  POSS
‘the king who built this house (he) is rich’ (Lesage 2020: 328)
```

Kam is coded 1 in Grambank.

A correlative relative clause in Bambara:

```
muso   min   taara,  o    ye    fini   san
woman  REL   leave   3SG  PST   cloth  buy

GB331,Are there non-adjacent relative clauses?,"## Are there non-adjacent relative clauses?

## Summary
Is there a non-correlative relative clause that is not adjacent to its modified noun? For example, in ***[The woman]** is tall **[who has a green hat]***, the noun (*woman*) is not adjacent to its modifying relative clause (*who has a green hat*). It must be possible for the head noun to be any noun, not only an unspecific (pro)noun (e.g. *whoever*). Do not consider correlative relative clauses for this feature (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)).

## Procedure

1. Code 1 if a source mentions that there are non-adjacent relative clauses, or that relative clauses may be separated from their head noun by other constituents.
2. Code 1 if you find examples in the description of non-adjacent relative clauses.
3. Code 0 if a source mentions that there are only adjacent relative clauses, or that relative clauses may not be separated from their head noun by other constituents.
4. Code 0 if a source comprehensively describes relative clauses but does not discuss non-adjacent relative clauses.
5. Code ? if there are examples that contain potential non-adjacent relative clauses.
6. Code ? if the source does not treat relative clauses in much detail and may have missed non-adjacent relative clauses.

## Examples

**Ottawa** (ISO 639-3: otw, Glottolog: otta1242)

For Ottawa, Valentine (2001: 581–582) describes ""non-contiguous relative clauses"", where the relative clause is separated from its head noun. Ottawa is coded 1.

```
Mshkikwaaboo     gye   wgii-wzhitoonaawaa   waa-aabjitoowaad.
liquid.medicine  and   ANIM.PL-made:INANIM  REL-ANIM.PL:will.use:INANIM
‘They made liquid medicine that they were going to use.’ 
(literally: ‘Liquid medicine they made that they were going to use.’) (Valentine 2001: 582)
```

**Pendau** (ISO 639-3: ums, Glottolog: pend1242) 

For Pendau, Quick (2007: 508) explicitly mentions that relative clauses always immediately follow the argument that they modify. This implies that they cannot be separated from their head noun. Pendau is coded 0.

GB333,Is there a decimal numeral system?,"## Is there a decimal numeral system?

## Summary

Are any multiples of 10 starting from 30 formed with a decimal base? e.g. 30 = 3x10, 40 = 4x10, etc. Or are expressions between these decimals (30-40, 40-50 etc.) formed as 30+1, 30+2, .., 30+9 etc.? The coding should reflect the earliest attested (i.e. not merely inferred) stage so if a pre-borrowing stage is attested, this should be coded.

## Procedure

1. If both an earlier stage and a borrowed numeral system are attested, only code the earlier stage.
2. If only a clearly borrowed numeral system is attested, and nothing is known about an earlier stage, code ?
3. If in doubt whether the numeral system is borrowed or not, code it as if it were not borrowed.
4. Code 1 if a source mentions that there is a decimal numeral system and you can verify this in the presented numerals.
5. Code 1 if you find a decimal numeral system in the numerals presented in a grammar or a dictionary.
6. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no decimal numeral system and you can verify this in the presented data.
7. Code 0 if a language has a minimal numeral system that does not contain numerals beyond 20.
8. Code ? if the source does not contain enough data (e.g. not enough numerals) to verify whether or not there is a decimal numeral system. 

## Examples

**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

Many Germanic languages have a suffix for multiples of 10 derived from *-tig ‘group of 10’. *-tig has a reflex *-ty* in English. English is coded 1 for this feature.

```
thirty = three-ty
forty = four-ty
fifty = five-ty
...
```

English numerals in between multiples of 10 are also formed according to a decimal system.

```
thirty-one
thirty-two
...
thirty-six
...
thirty-nine
```

**French** (ISO 639-3: fra, Glottolog: stan1290)

French has a vigesimal numeral system for 80 and 90 and a decimal system for most other multiples of 10. French is coded 1 for this feature.

```
20    vingt              twenty
30    trente             tre-ante (cf. ‘three-ty’)
40    quarante           quatre-ante (cf. ‘four-ty’)
50    cinquante          cinque-ante (cf. ‘five-ty’)

80    quatre-vingt       four-twenties
90    quatre-vingt-dix   four-twenties-ten
```


**Papapana** (ISO 639-3: ppn, Glottolog: papa1265)

Papapana has a quinary system for numerals between 5 and 10 and a decimal system for forming multiples of 10 (Smith 2015: 94). Papapana is coded 1 for this feature.

```

**Amkoe** (ISO 639-3: huc, Glottolog: hoaa1235)

Some languages have a minimal numeral system that does not include numerals higher than a certain number. Amkoe, for example, only has numerals up to three or four, depending on the variety (Collins & Gruber 2014: 133-137). Amkoe is coded 0 for this feature.

GB334,Is there synchronic evidence for any element of a quinary numeral system?,"## Is there synchronic evidence for any element of a quinary numeral system?

## Summary
Are any numerals above 5 formed with 5 as a base? For example, 6 = 5+1, 7 = 5+2, 8 = 5+3, 9 = 5+4, 11 = 5+5+1, etc.? One example of this is enough for a 1, except if it can be derived from an already existing non-quinary system (e.g. if 10 = 5x2, but other numerals are also formed by doubling, e.g. 4 = 2x2 and 6 = 3x2, this does not count).

## Procedure

1. If both an earlier stage and a borrowed numeral system are attested, only code the earlier stage.
2. If only a clearly borrowed numeral system is attested, and nothing is known about an earlier stage, code ?.
3. If in doubt whether the numeral system is borrowed or not, code it as if it were not borrowed.

Awar has a quinary numeral system for numbers from 6 to 9 and a vigesimal system for multiples of twenty (Levy 2002: 159-161). The numeral for 5 is derived from the noun for ‘hand’ and the numeral for 10 is the plural of ‘hand’. The author does not mention how other multiples of ten are formed. Awar is coded 1 for this feature.

**Tongva** (ISO 639-3: xgf, Glottolog: tong1329)

Tongva has a numeral for 10 that literally means ‘two times five’ so would appear to have a quinary system. Upon closer inspection, however, the system is based on multiplication by 2, not multiplication by 5 (Hill & Hill 2019: 1371). Tongva is coded 0 for this feature.

GB336,Is there a body-part tallying system?,"## Is there a body-part tallying system?

## Summary

Body-part tallying systems are counting systems that use body parts other than hands, feet, fingers or toes. Counting starts from one hand, tallying parts of the body along the arm, up to the head and then continuing with symmetric tally points down the other side of the body. Body-part tallying systems are usually only used in some social situations, such as traditional bride price negotiations. Some languages with decimal, quinary or vigesimal systems use words for *head* or *body* to represent *10* or *20*, the word for *hand* to mean *5* or the word for *eye* to mean *1*. These do not count as body-part tallying systems in the absence of a sequence of other body-part tally points. 

## Procedure

1. If both an earlier stage and a borrowed counting system are attested, only code the earlier stage.
2. If only a clearly borrowed counting system is attested, and nothing is known about an earlier stage, code ?.
3. If in doubt whether a counting system is borrowed or not, code it as if it were not borrowed. Note that a language can have different counting systems existing in parallel.
4. Code 1 if a source mentions that there is a body-part tallying system and you can verify this in the presented numerals.
5. Code 1 if you find a body-part tallying system in the numerals presented in a grammar or a dictionary.
6. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no body-part tallying system or you can verify this in the presented data.
7. Code 0 if a language has a minimal counting system (e.g. if there are no numerals beyond 4 or 5).
8. Code ? if the source does not contain enough data (e.g. not enough numerals) to verify whether or not there is a body-part tallying system. 

## Examples

**Kobon** (ISO 639-3: kpw, Glottolog: kobo1249)

Kobon has a body-part tallying system (Comrie n.d.). Counting in Kobon starts on the left little finger and runs on to the right middle finger, after which counting continues back in the direction of the left side of the body. In this system, the same terms are used for the left and right body parts, which means that their meaning can be ambiguous out of context (e.g. *wañɨg nöbö* ‘little finger’ may mean ‘1’ or ‘24’). Kobon would be coded 1.

GB400,"Are all person categories neutralized in some voice, tense, aspect, mood and/or negation?","## Are all person categories neutralized in some voice, tense, aspect, mood and/or negation?

## Summary
This question concerns languages which can [index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) the person of an [argument (S, A or P)](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) somewhere in the clause (i.e. either on the verb or by clitics). The question asks whether person categories are not distinguished under certain circumstances. In order for there to be neutralization, there needs to be something to ‘neutralize’ to begin with, i.e. languages without person indexing should be coded 0 for this feature. All person categories should be neutralized for the language to be coded as 1. Do not consider [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) pronouns for this question. Consider only independent clauses. Consider only the moods which allow all person categories of the language to be expressed (that is, ignore imperatives, jussives, etc.)

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with verbal morphology, specifically the sections on (pronominal) agreement or argument cross-referencing.
2. If no argument is indexed on verbs, code 0.
3. If some arguments are indexed, check if there are any mentions in the sections on TAM, voice or negation of these markers being deleted under the respective circumstances. Ignore clause types which are incompatible with some person categories, e.g. imperatives. Consider only independent clauses.
5. If the indexes are deleted, code 1 and add a comment on the conditions.
6. If they are never deleted, code 0.

## Examples

**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

In the English Simple present, the verb indexes person via the opposition between the suffix _-s_ vs. zero marking. Also there is person indexing in various tenses built analytically with the help of the auxiliary _to be_. In the Simple Past, however, there is no person indexing whatsoever, e.g. *I/he/she/you worked*. Thus, we can speak of neutralization of person categories. English is coded as 1.

**Irula** (ISO 639-3: iru, Glottolog: irul1243)

Irula has systematic tense distinctions in the negative forms of verbs. The negative verb forms do not show any person-gender-number markers (Zvelebil 1973: 27). The non-past negative is formed by suffixing the negative morph *-ale* to the non-past tense stem. The past negative is formed by the same marker _-ale_ added to the past stem. Irula is coded as 1.

```
Non-past positive
1SG      var(u)ge   ‘I come’
2SG      var(u)ga   ‘you come’
3SG.M    var(u)ge   ‘he comes’
…
1PL.EXCL var(u)gamu ‘we (excl.) come’
1PL.INCL var(u)giri ‘we (incl.) come’
2PL      var(u)giri ‘you come’
2PL.HUM  var(u)garu ‘they come’
2PL.NHUM var(u)gina ‘they come’

Non-past negative
var(u)gale   ‘I (you, he ...) do not come, I (you, he ...) shall not come’
pa:k(k)ale   ‘I do not see’

Past negative
vandale      ‘I ... have not come’
pa:t(t)ale   ‘I ... did not see’
(Zvelebil 1973: 27)
```

GB401,Is there a class of patient-labile verbs?,"## Is there a class of patient-labile verbs?

## Summary

The term ‘labileʼ is the most commonly used label for verbs which can be used transitively or intransitively without any formal change.
A distinction is made between patient lability, more commonly referred to as [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P))-lability, and agent lability or [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P))-lability.
P-lability stands for patient-preserving lability, that is, the P argument is preserved in the intransitive construction, as in _I broke **the stick**_[P] / _**The stick** broke_. A-lability stands for agent-preserving lability, that is the A argument is preserved in the intransitive construction, as in _**John**_[A] _drinks tea / **John** drinks_. 

This question asks only about P-labile verbs. Semantically, two things can happen with P-labile verbs. In case of (a) argument structure modifying P-lability, an otherwise transitive verb is used in the intransitive construction encoding an argument structure from which the A argument of the transitive construction is absent. In case of (b) less common argument structure preserving P-lability, the verb in its intransitive use implies the same participants with the same roles as in its transitive use, but in the intransitive use, the A argument is not expressed and is interpreted as non-specific.

## Procedure
1. Search for the terms ‘labile’, ‘lability’, ‘ambitransitive’ and ‘semitransitive’ in the description. If these terms are not mentioned, look up the sections on valency and transitivity in the description.
2. If no such sections exists, search for examples containing terms such as ‘burn’, ‘melt’ and ‘break’/‘broke’ and consider the relevant examples.
3. Decide whether you can find support for a set of P-labile verbs, according to the definition above. If you find examples for at least two verbs, code as 1.
4. If the source has detailed sections on valence and transitivity and labile verbs are not mentioned, code as 0.
5. If you cannot find enough information, code as ?.

## Examples

**English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)

In English, some verbs can be used transitively, as in (1) or intransitively, as in (2). In the intransitive use of P-labile verbs there is no agent in the argument structure of the verb. English is coded 1 for this feature.

```
1. Transitive
(a) The child [A] broke the glass [P].
(b) The sun [A] melted the ice [P].
(c) The fire [A] burnt down the house [P].

2. Intransitive
(a) The glass broke.
(b) The ice melted.
(a) The house burnt down.
```

**Awara** (ISO 639-3: awx, Glottolog: awar1248)

""For a few semitransitive verbs, the subject of the transitive frame has the semantic role of agent, while the subject of the intransitive frame has the role of patient. For example, the verbs _det_ ‘detach’ and _buhapmäng_ ‘knot’ have a transitive frame with an agent subject and a patient object, [as in (1)] and an intransitive frame with a patient subject, [as in (2)]. As usual, subject-indexing is marked by a suffix on the verb. (In the examples, the subject-indexing suffixes and the argument with the role of patient are underlined.)"" (Quigley 2002: 48)
Awara is coded as 1. 

```
(1) Transitive
a. Kopi   apme   de–wit.
   coffee later  detach–1SG.FUT
   ‘I’ll pick coffee later.’ (Quigley 2002: 48)

b. Nap  buhapmäng–Ø.
   rope knot–2SG.IMMEDIATE
   ‘Knot the rope.’ (Quigley 2002: 48)
   
(2) Intransitive
a. Kwalem   salin apme  de–ke          ep-ning              gämänä   ti–ke.
   tree.sp. seed  later detach–SS.PFV  come.down–2/3PL.FUT  red      be–SS.PFV
   ‘The ‘kwalem' seeds will detach and come down when they turn red.’ (Quigley 2002: 49)

b. Nap  täknga=yal=u        a=buhapmä–mäläk. 
   rope CL.rope=two.DEF=TOP PREDICATE.FOC=knot–2/3DU.PRS
   ‘The two ropes knotted.’ (Quigley 2002: 49)

GB402,Does the verb for 'see' have suppletive verb forms?,"## Does the verb for ‘see’ have suppletive verb forms?

## Summary
This question concerns strong suppletion in verb(s) of seeing/watching/looking. Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. ‘Weak’ suppletion is not included. An example of this is English _went_ and _go_. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. 

Please note that we are not interested in words that are translated as ‘look for’, ‘seek’ etc. This feature is concerned with the transitive verb of the act of seeing, not with metaphorical extensions such as 'seek up’.

## Procedure
1. Look up the section on verbs of seeing.
2. If none exist, search for the words ‘see’, ‘look’ and ‘watch’.
3. If the verb paradigm for ‘see’ is not described, code as ?.
4. If the verb ‘see’ is described as being non-variant in any way, code as 0.
5. If the verb ‘see’ is suppletive anywhere, code as 1.

## Examples
**Polish** (ISO 639-3: pol, Glottolog: poli1260) 

In Polish, there is suppletion for the verb for ‘to see’ in regards to aspect (Swan 2002: 289). In the imperfective, the stem *widzieç* is used. In the perfective, *zobaczyć* is used. These stems are different enough to count as suppletion. Polish would be coded 1 for this feature. The table below show the two stems in infinitive form.

| TAM value| Verb |
| --- | --- |
| Imperfective | widzieć ‘to see/to be seeing’ |
| Perfective | zobaczyć ‘to catch sight of’ |

Samoan has suppletive forms for ‘come’ corresponding to different number values of the S or A argument (Milner 1966: 202). Coincidentally, this makes the plural form ambiguous for ‘come’ and ‘go’. Samoan is coded 1 for this feature.

GB408,Is there any accusative alignment of flagging?,"## Is there any accusative alignment of flagging?

## Summary
Are [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments flagged differently from  [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments (i.e. do they show accusative alignment)? Flagging covers any kind of argument marking on the argument itself (e.g. by case or adposition marking). The marking can be phonologically free or bound. The marking of [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments is not relevant for establishing whether there is any accusative flagging or not, it is the difference between S and P flagging that results in 1. 
In case of split flagging systems (specifically, differential object marking), code as 1 if any of the subsystems (e.g. only nouns or only pronouns, or a particular group of nouns) shows accusative alignment. Note that although alignment types are occasionally associated with entire languages (e.g. when one says that ""Dyirbal is an ergative language""), they in fact apply only to individual constructions. This question asks only about the alignment of flagging, the alignment of [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or of any other construction is irrelevant for this question.

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with nominal morphology, argument marking and/or basic clause structure. If no such section exists, consider examples of transitive and intransitive clauses, identify overt arguments in different roles (S, A, and P) and study their marking. The special P flag is often called accusative, but it can be labeled differently (e.g. dative or oblique).
2. Check whether any of the S, A or P arguments are flagged in any context. Consider only the major predicate class, ignore any verbs with non-canonical/special flagging (e.g. the so-called ‘dative-subject’ or experiencer verbs). Consider only independent clauses.
3. Code 0 if there is never overt flagging of any of the three arguments S, A, and P.
4. Code 0 if S and P are always flagged identically, this includes cases with no overt flagging (i.e. zero marking).
5. If there is a special flag for P, check whether it is used in all contexts. In particular, be aware of differences in flagging conditioned by a pronoun vs. noun distinction, person, animacy, definiteness, etc. (this situation is generally known as differential object marking or DOM). Code 1 even if only some pronouns or only some nouns (e.g. the inanimate ones) are flagged differently when they are P arguments. If, however, a small random class of nouns does not take a particular flagging for phonological or morphological reasons, ignore this class.
6. If there are differences in flagging conditioned by TAM distinctions, consider the distribution in individual TAM contexts. Code 1 if P is flagged differently from A in some TAM categories.
7. The so-called tripartite flagging pattern (S flagged differently from A and differently from P) receives 1 for both GB408 and [GB409](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB409).

## Examples

**Imonda** (ISO 639-3: imn, Glottolog: imon1245)

Imonda flags only animate P arguments with a special suffix glossed as -GL, as in (c). 
Inanimate Ps are unmarked, as in (d). This is sufficient to code Imonda as having accusative alignment of flagging, though this alignment type is restricted to animate arguments. Imonda is coded as 1 for both GB408 and [GB410](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB410).

This question asks only about the alignment of flagging, the alignment of [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or of any other construction is irrelevant for this question.

## Procedure
1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with nominal morphology, argument marking and/or basic clause structure. If no such section exists, consider examples of transitive and intransitive clauses, identify overt arguments in different roles (S, A, and P) and study their marking. The special A flag is often called ergative, but it can be labeled differently (e.g. agentive or instrumental).
2. Check whether any of the S, A or P arguments are flagged in any context. Consider only the major predicate class, ignore any verbs with non-canonical/special flagging (e.g. the so-called ‘dative-subject’ or experiencer verbs). Consider only independent clauses.
3. Code 0 if there is never overt flagging of any of the three arguments S, A, and P.
4. Code 0 if S and A are always flagged identically, this includes cases with no overt flagging (i.e. zero marking).
5. If there is a special flag for A, check whether it is used in all contexts. In particular, be aware of differences in flagging conditioned by a pronoun vs. noun distinction, person, animacy, definiteness, etc. (this situation is generally known as differential argument marking and in case of differential A marking as split ergativity). Code 1 even if only some pronouns or only some nouns (e.g. the inanimate ones) are flagged differently when they are A arguments. If, however, a small random class of nouns does not take a particular flagging for phonological or morphological reasons, ignore this class.
6. If there are differences in flagging conditioned by TAM distinctions, consider the distribution in individual TAM contexts. Code 1 if S is flagged differently from A in some TAM categories.
7. The so-called tripartite flagging pattern (S flagged differently from A and differently from P) receives 1 for both [GB408](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB408) and GB409.

## Examples

**Yakkha** (ISO 639-3: ybh, Glottolog: yakk1236)

In Yakkha all S and P arguments are in the unmarked nominative case, as in (a), (c) and (d). The A argument of the third person is marked with the ergative clitic *=ŋa*, as in (b), the first and second person A arguments are in the unmarked nominative, as in (e). The flagging with the ergative clitic *=ŋa* of some A arguments is sufficient to code Yakkha as 1 for this question (GB409). Furthermore, Yakkha is coded as 1 for [GB410 Is there any neutral alignment of flagging?](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB410), as the flagging of the first and second person pronouns is neutrally aligned.

## Summary
Are [S, A, and P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments flagged identically (i.e. are they neutrally aligned)? Flagging covers any kind of argument marking on the argument itself (e.g. by case or adposition marking). The marking can be phonologically free or bound. 
Reply with 1 if none of the three arguments is overtly flagged (i.e. if all three arguments are zero-marked). In case of differential flagging systems, reply with 1 if any of the subsystems (e.g. a particular tense) shows neutral alignment. Reply with 1 if only nouns or only pronouns shows neutral alignment. Reply with 1 also if some or just one personal pronoun shows neutral alignment. Reply with 1 if a substantial class of nouns shows neutral alignment. Note that although alignment types are occasionally associated with entire languages (e.g. when one says that ""Dyirbal is an ergative language""), they in fact apply only to individual constructions. This question asks only about the alignment of flagging, the alignment of [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or of any other construction is irrelevant for this question.

3. Code 1 if there is never overt flagging of any of the three arguments S, A, and P.
4. If there is a special flag for A or P, check whether it is used in all contexts. In particular, be aware of differences in marking conditioned by a pronoun vs. noun distinction, person, animacy, definiteness, etc. (this situation is known as differential argument marking). Code 1 even if only some pronouns or only some nouns (e.g. the indefinite ones) are identically flagged in all the three argument roles S, A, and P. If, however, a small random class of nouns is not flagged for phonological or morphological reasons, ignore this class.
5. If there are differences in flagging conditioned by TAM distinctions, consider the distribution in individual TAM contexts. Code 1 if S, A, and P are flagged identically in some TAM categories. 
6. Code 0 if A, P or both are always marked differently than S.

## Examples
**Imonda** (ISO 639-3: imn, Glottolog: imon1245)

Imonda marks animate P arguments with a special ‘goal’ marker glossed as -GL (see example c). However, when one considers inanimate arguments, S, A, and P are unmarked and thus show neutral alignment (cf. c. and d). Imonda is coded as 1 for both GB410 and [GB408](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB408).

**Yakkha** (ISO 639-3: ybh, Glottolog: yakk1236)

In Yakkha all S and P arguments are in the unmarked nominative case, as in (a), (c) and (d). The A argument of the third person is marked with the ergative clitic *=ŋa*, as in (b), the first and second person A arguments are in the unmarked nominative, as in (e). Yakkha is coded as 1 for GB410, as the flagging of the first and second person pronouns is neutrally aligned. Furthermore, Yakkha is 1 for this question [GB409](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB409) because of the ergative alignment of flagging with third person arguments.

**Makasae-Makalero** (ISO 639-3: mkz, Glottolog: maka1316)

In Makasae-Makalero the core arguments are never overtly flagged, this is true for both pronominal (a-c) and nominal (d) arguments. Thus S, A and P are always flagged identically yielding the neutral alignment. Makasae-Makalero is coded as 1.

GB415,Is there a politeness distinction in 2nd person forms?,"## Is there a politeness distinction in second person forms?

## Summary
This feature asks whether there are different second person pronoun forms that are used based on the level of respect accorded by the speaker to the addressee. In some cases polite pronouns are used to indicate a level of formality or unfamiliarity between speaker and addressee. In other cases politeness distinctions are used according to very specific social relationships between speaker and addressee, such as relative age, social status, or kinship. If multiple second person pronoun forms exist in a single number category, and their use is patterned according to the level of intimacy or hierarchy of social relationship between speaker and addressee, this will suffice for a 1 code. The contrastive forms may or may not have other uses (e.g. in French the form *tu* is used only for second person singular informal, while *vous* is used for both second person singular polite and second person plural); a politeness distinction triggers a 1 for this feature regardless of whether the relevant forms have other functions/meanings.

## Procedure
1. If there exist, for any number category, multiple second person pronoun forms,
2. And if the contrast between those pronoun forms is used to indicate respect or intimacy, or if the pronouns differ according to social relationships between the speaker and the addressee, code 1.
3. If multiple second person pronoun forms exist for any number category but their usage does not reflect social relationships, intimacy or respect, then code 0.
4. If there are not multiple second person pronoun forms for any number category, code 0.
5. If there are multiple pronominal forms that are used for second person meanings that express a distinction in politeness, and these forms are also used to express other distinctions in the pronoun paradigm, this is sufficient to code 1.

## Examples
**Czech** (ISO 639-3: ces, Glottolog: czec1258)

There are two series of second person pronouns in Czech. One (*ty* in nominative case) is used for informal address in only the singular, as when addressing someone you are on familiar terms with or a child. The other (*vy* in nominative case) is used for a more formal register in the singular, for example when addressing a stranger or someone more senior. *vy* is also used to express the second person plural, regardless of the level of formality (Naughton 2005: 74).

```
a. (Spoken by teacher to child)  
   Ty       jsi         student  
   2SG.NOM  be.2SG.PRS  student  
   ‘You are a student.’ (Naughton 2005: 74)

b. (Spoken by child to teacher)  
   Vy       jste        učitel
   2SG.NOM  be.2SG.PRS  teacher  
   ‘You are a teacher.’ (Naughton 2005: 74)
```

Although the pronominal forms used for formal second person singular are identical to the second person plural forms, and no formality contrast exists in the plural, the formality contrast in the second person singular pronouns is sufficient to trigger a 1.

GB421,Is there a preposed complementizer in complements of verbs of thinking and/or knowing?,"## Is there a preposed complementizer for complements of verbs of thinking and/or knowing?

## Summary

Complementizers are markers (free or bound) which are able to turn a clause into the subject or object of a sentence. In some of the literature these are also known as ‘conjunctions’. The complementizer in the sentence *I knew **that** Ashley was a genius* is _**that**_ and it is preposed to the complement clause (*Ashley was a genius*). The complementizer does not have to be [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence), the position in relation to the complement clause is what is relevant. This feature concerns whether the complementizer precedes the complement or not.

This feature specifically targets sentences with verbs of thinking and knowing, where the complement clause is an object (*I know that he is truthful* or *I think that this is a bad idea*). This is done so that we get more comparable data across the sample.

## Procedure
1) In the sections or chapters that deal with complex syntax, investigate where the complementizer is positioned in relation to complements of verbs of knowing and thinking and code accordingly.
2) If this is not described but several examples exist which consistently show the complementizer as preposed, code 1.

## Examples

**Swedish** (ISO 639-3: swe, Glottolog: swed1254)

In Swedish, the complementizer is preposed to the complement clause. For example, in the sentence: _jag visste **att** Ashley var ett geni_ ‘I knew that Ashely was a genius’, the complementizer _**att**_ is preposed to the complement clause (*Ashley var ett geni*). Swedish is coded 1 (see Holmes & Hinchliffe 2013: 343).

GB430,Can adnominal possession be marked by a prefix on the possessor?,"## Can adnominal possession be marked by a prefix on the possessor?

## Summary
This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where a possessor (either nominal or pronominal) is marked with a [prefix or proclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) to indicate possession of an object. This frequently takes the form of a genitive prefix on a possessor, but may also involve other types of prefixes or proclitics. Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that precedes and is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) to the possessor nominal/pronominal.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is an adnominal possession construction marked by any element which is phonologically bound to the possessor noun/pronoun, and which precedes that noun/pronoun.
2. Code 0 if there is no adnominal possession construction in which a prefix or proclitic on the possessor noun/pronoun functions to mark possession.
3. Code 0 if the only relevant adnominal possession construction is marked only by tone, not by a prefix or proclitic.

## Examples

**Zulu** (ISO 639-3: zul, Glottolog: zulu1248)

""The possessor noun is usually preceded by a prefix that shows agreement with the possessee, called possessive agreement."" (de Dreu 2008: 44)

```
a. ukhezo         lomfazi  
   u-khezo        lwa-u-mfazi  
   AUG-CL11.spoon POSS.CL11-AUG-woman  
   ‘the spoon of a woman’ (de Dreu 2008: 44)

b. i-ngane       ya-mi  
   AUG-CL9.child POSS.CL9-N1SG  
   ‘child of mine’ (de Dreu 2008: 45)
```

Zulu would be coded 1, because the possessive agreement morpheme is phonologically dependent on the possessor noun or pronoun and it precedes that noun/pronoun. The relative order of possessor and possessum is not important to this feature, nor is the exact nature of the possessive-flagging prefix (here it marks possession and agreement with the possessum; in other languages it could be something else such as a genitive marker).

**Nanti** (ISO 639-3: cox, Glottolog: nant1250)

```
a. i-banko  
   3SG.M-house  
   ‘his house’ (Michael 2012: 151)

b. i-banko     Ihonira  
   3SG.M-house Ihonira 
   ‘Ihonira’s house’ (Michael 2012: 151)

c. irashi     i-banko  
   3SG.M.POSS 3SG.M-house  
   ‘his house’ (Michael 2012: 152)

d. i-gemari-te  
   3SG.M-tapir-ALIEN.POSS  
   ‘his tapir’ (Michael 2012: 152)
```

Inalienable possession in Nanti is expressed by a prefix on the possessed noun that indicates the person, number and gender of the possessor. A nominal possessor or possessive pronoun may also be included in the phrase. Nominal possessors follow the possessed noun in unmarked constructions. They may appear to the left of the possessum when they are in contrastive focus. Pronominal possessors occur to the left of possessed nouns. Alienable possession uses the same prefixes as inalienable possession, but also includes an alienable possession suffix on the possessed noun. Nanti would be coded 1 because it has a possessive construction that uses a prefix on the possessed noun to mark the possession relationship (see Michael 2012: 151–152).

GB432,Can adnominal possession be marked by a suffix on the possessor?,"## Can adnominal possession be marked by a suffix on the possessor?

## Summary
This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where a possessor (either nominal or pronominal) is marked with a [suffix or enclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) to indicate possession of an object. This frequently takes the form of a genitive suffix on a possessor, but may also involve other types of suffixes or enclitics. Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that follows and is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) to the possessor noun/pronoun.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is an adnominal possessive construction marked by an element which is phonologically bound  to the possessor noun phrase or pronoun, and which follows that noun/pronoun.
2. Code 0 if there is no adnominal possession construction in which a suffix or enclitic on the possessor noun/pronoun functions to mark possession.
3. Code 0 if the only relevant adnominal possession construction is marked by tone alone, not by a suffix or enclitic.

## Examples

**Southeastern Pomo** (ISO 639-3: pom, Glottolog: sout2982)

Possession is marked by a suffix *-it* on the possessor, and in the case of alienable possession an additional suffix *-baq*, which indicates that the relationship between possessor and possessum is alienable. Southeastern Pomo would be coded 1.

```
a. hayut     xin
   hayu-it   xin
   dog-POSS  name
   ‘the dog’s name’ (Moshinsky 1974: 95)

b. bṭedit      xal
   bṭed-it     xal
   woman-POSS  arm
   ‘the woman’s arm’ (Moshinsky 1974: 95)

c. hayutbaq        ca
   hayu-it-baq     ca
   dog-POSS-ALIEN  house
   ‘the dog’s house’ (Moshinsky 1974: 95)

d. Ɂuyitbaq        ca
   Ɂuyi-it-baq     ca
   3SG-POSS-ALIEN  house
   ‘his house’ (Moshinsky 1974: 95)
```

**Wappo** (ISO 639-3: wao, Glottolog: wapp1239)

Wappo expresses alienable possession by marking the possessor noun or pronoun with a genitive suffix.

``` 
a. me-meɁ   chipe  tu:nikuɁ
   2SG-GEN  red    dress
   ‘your red dress’ (Thompson et al. 2014: 9)

b. k'ew-meɁ  k'ešu
   man-GEN   meat
   ‘the man’s meat’ (Thompson et al. 2014: 14)
```

Wappo would be coded 1 because this genitive suffix marks possessive relationships and is phonologically bound to the right of the possessor noun.

## Summary
This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where possession is marked by a [suffix or enclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) on the possessed noun. In some cases, the possessive suffix indexes agreement categories of the possessor. Crucially, the possession must be marked by a [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) element that follows and is phonologically bound to the possessed noun.

## Procedure
1. Code 1 if there is an adnominal possessive construction marked by an element which is phonologically bound to the possessed noun, and which occurs to the right of that noun.
2. Code 0 if there is no adnominal possession construction in which a suffix or enclitic on the possessed noun marks possession.
3. Code 0 if the only relevant adnominal possession construction is marked only by tone, not by a suffix or enclitic.

## Examples

**Nganasan** (ISO 639-3: nio, Glottolog: ngan1291)

""The relationship between the modifier (the possessor) and the head (the possessed noun) is encoded by possessive suffixes on the head and/or a Genitive case suffix appearing on the possessor."" (Wagner-Nagy 2014: 76)

```
a. (mənə) d’esɨ-mə
   (1SG)  father-1SG.POSS
   ‘my father’ (Wagner-Nagy 2014: 77)

b. (tənə) d’esɨ-tə             ban-tu
   (2SG)  father-GEN.2SG.POSS  dog-3SG.POSS
   ‘your father’s dog’ (Wagner-Nagy 2014: 77)

c. d’ed’i       ban-tu
   father.GEN   dog-3SG.POSS
   ‘father’s dog’ (Wagner-Nagy 2014: 77)
```

Nganasan would be coded 1 for this feature, because a common strategy for marking possession involves possessive suffixes on the possessed noun. It does not matter for this feature that when the possessor is specified with a noun or pronoun it must be in genitive case (but the availability of a strategy for marking possession on the possessor with a genitive suffix in this language would also trigger a 1 for [GB432](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB432)).

GB519,"Can mood be marked by a non-inflecting word (""auxiliary particle"")?","## Can mood be marked by a non-inflecting word (‘auxiliary particle')?

## Summary
This feature covers all grammatical moods (the relationship between the referred event/state/action and reality and/or speakers' attitude toward what they are saying) and aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) elements that do not inflect (i.e. do not change form depending on person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These markers are often described as ‘[particles](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles)' in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking. 

There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that a mood is expressed by a certain form on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing mood then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB519) and the feature on bound mood marking ([GB312](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB312)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing a mood, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.

While negation or interrogation can be considered as grammatical moods, they are not included in this feature.

## Procedure
1. Look up the section on mood marking in the grammatical description.
2. Consider all marking of mood, e.g. not only conditional.
3. If you do not find any non-inflecting phonologically free mood markers, code as 0.
4. If there is a non-inflecting phonologically free marker that clearly marks mood, code the language as 1.
5. If it is not clear whether the marker marks mood, code the language as ?.

## Examples
**Hawai'ian** (ISO 639-3: haw, Glottolog: hawa1245)

Hawai'ian marks imperative/intentive mood with _e/ø, ō_ and _i_. When used with the second person it denotes imperative mood (see example a), but when used with the first or third persons the meaning denotes a vague desire, need, purpose, necessity or probability (see example b, Elbert & Pukui 1979: 61). The glossing in the examples is done by the patron.

```
a. E hele 'oe
   IMP/INT go 2sg
   ‘You must go!’ (Elbert & Pukui 1979: 61)

b. Malia ō hele au
   Perhaps IMP/INT go 1sg
   ‘Maybe I'll go’ (Elbert & Pukui 1979: 61)

```

Hawai'ian is coded 1.

## Examples
**Samoan** (ISO 639-3: smo, Glottolog: samo1305)

Samoan has two different particles for past tense that differ in terms of aspect. _Sā_ is the more general marker, and _na_ denotes punctual events. Samoan is coded 1 for this feature. The examples below are taken from Mosel & So’o (1997: 21), with glossing by Skirgård.

GB522,"Can the S or A argument be omitted from a pragmatically unmarked clause when the referent is inferrable from context (""pro-drop"" or ""null anaphora"")?","## Can the S or A argument be omitted from a pragmatically unmarked clause when the referent is inferable from context (‘pro-drop’)?

## Summary
This feature identifies languages that do not require a phonologically overt [S or A argument](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) expressed by a noun phrase or [phonologically independent pronoun](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) when the referent can be inferred from context. These languages are often called ‘pro-drop’ languages, and the phenomenon is generally referred to as ‘null anaphora’ or ‘zero anaphora’. 

Here ‘omitted’ means phonologically unexpressed (we do not intend for this feature to make any distinctions regarding the theoretical status of a null argument). To count as 1, pro-drop should occur where the S or A argument might otherwise be expressed by an independent pronoun or full noun phrase. Specifically, pro-drop should occur in simple, declarative main clauses. 

Pro-drop is not mutually exclusive with [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) of the S or A argument on the verb. If, in the absence of an independent pronoun or nominal S or A, there is indexing of this argument on the verb, you may still code 1.

## Procedure
1. If the S or A argument may be omitted in a pragmatically unmarked main clause when its referent can be inferred from context, code 1.
2. If the S or A argument is always phonologically expressed by a noun phrase or phonologically independent pronoun in a pragmatically unmarked main clause, code 0.
3. If the S or A argument may be omitted in a pragmatically unmarked main clause when its referent can be inferred from context, but only if that referent represents a certain person/number category, code 1 and provide a comment that describes under what condition the S or A argument may be omitted.

## Examples
**Czech** (ISO 639-3: ces, Glottolog: czec1258)

Czech allows S and A arguments to be expressed by pronouns when the referent is understood from context, but it also allows these subject arguments to be phonologically unexpressed.

```
a. Jan  včera      navštív-il
   Jan  yesterday  visit-PST.M
   ‘Jan visited yesterday.’

b. (on)     říd-il        auto
   (3SG.M)  drive-PST.M   car
   ‘He drove a car.’

c. (on)      m-ěl         tři    kufr-y
   (3SG.M)   have-PST.M   three  suitcase-PL
   ‘He had three suitcases.’
```
The pronouns in parenthesis in the examples above can be omitted, and in fact would be in most natural contexts. The resulting constructions with no phonologically overt subjects where a pronoun would otherwise occur would lead to a 1 code for Czech.

**Aneityum** (ISO 639-3: aty, Glottolog: anei1239)

Subjects are always expressed in Aneityum by either a lexical noun phrase or a phonologically independent pronoun (or both, in the case of the subject topicalisation construction) (Lynch 2000: 114–116).
```
a. et       apam  plen
   3SG.AOR  come  plane
   ‘The plane is coming.’ (Lynch 2000: 115)

b. et       itiyi  hag  aan  a     nuyaleg
   3SG.AOR  NEG    eat  3SG  TEMP  morning
   ‘He/she didn’t eat in the morning/this morning.’ (Lynch 2000: 123)
```
Though it is not relevant to the simple declarative clauses targeted by this feature, it is interesting to note that this language even overtly expresses subjects with phonologically independent pronouns in imperative clauses:
```
c. adia     aak
   go.away  you.SG
   ‘Go away!’ (Lynch 2000: 137)
```
Aneityum does not allow pro-drop and is thus coded 0.
